    Is

    $$
    y =  \cos(x + 0.1)
    $$

    the shift of $y = \cos(x)$ to the left by $0.1$,
    or to the right by $0.1$?

    |> Solution
        The function $x \ra \cos(x + 0.1)$ fetches its values

        __in the future__

        by $0.1$, compared to $\cos(x)$. It is therefore

        __ahead__

        or its graph

        __to the left__

        of $y = \cos(x)$, by $0.1$.

|> Exercise

    Guesstimate a function with this graph:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_10x_plus_x_over_4.svg

    |> Solution

        It appears that the function is “a line plus
        something”, in the sense of the following
        diagram:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_10x_plus_x_over_4_equation.svg

        (Or in the technical sense of taking the sum
        of two functions, to be more exact—that is what
        the sum of two functions looks like, pictorialized!)

        The line appears to be
        $$
        y = {1\over 4}x
        $$
        making it a true _linear_ function (as opposed
        to _affine_, cf. Chapter 3).

        As for the “something”—the bumpy one—it appears
        to just be a “sped up cosine”, and note that
        the graph goes through approximately $10$
        cycles between $x = 0$ and $x = 6.28 \approx 4\eta$,
        as we can count on the graph of the original
        function:

        |> ImageLeft
            line=-2
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_10x_plus_x_over_4_4eta_cloud.svg

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_10x_plus_x_over_4_bump_count.svg

        As cos goes through _one_ cycle from $x = 0$ to
        $x = 4\eta$, the “bumpy function” is therefore
        (roughly, from what we can see) a “$10$&#x200b;$\times$”
        sped-up version of cosine, i.e.,
        $$
        y = \cos(10x)
        $$
        from which the guesstimate for the initial function
        would be
        $$
        y = \cos(10x) + {1\over 4} x
        $$
        adding our two separate guesstimates together.

|> Exercise

    Guesstimate a function with this graph (we can
    tell you that the large-scale curve is a
    parabola):

    |> Image
        style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_minus_cos_20x_plus_quadratic.svg

    |> Solution

        Having intimated that the answer is the sum of
        a parabola and of some cosine deviant, let us
        focus on the parabolic portion first, that would
        namely be roughly this purple curve:

        |> Image
            style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_minus_cos_20x_plus_quadratic_with_parabola.svg

        [Nb:

        __parabolic__

        is a synonym of

        __quadratic__

        or

        __degree $\mathit{2}$ polynomial__

        i.e., a function of the form
        $$
        x \ra a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0
        $$
        for constants $a_2$, $a_1$, $a_0 \in \rr$, cf. Chapter 3.]

        As the parabola is symmetric about the $y$ axis it will
        be of the form
        $$
        y = Ax^2 + C
        $$
        for some constants $A$, $C \in \rr$.
        (And specifically
        without a
        “$Bx$”
        term, that would break symmetry.)

        The value
        $$
        C
        $$
        is easy because it is the value of the parabola at
        $x = 0$, which in this case appears to be $y = -3$:

        |> Image
            style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_minus_cos_20x_plus_quadratic_C_estimate.svg

        ...so...
        $$
        C = -3
        $$

        (we say). For $A$,
        note that the parabola appears to have value $y \approx 3$
        at $x = \pm 12$, resulting in an increase of $\approx 6$
        between $x = 0$ and $x = \pm 12$:

        |> Image
            style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_minus_cos_20x_plus_quadratic_A_estimate.svg

        That increase being entirely due to the term
        $Ax^2$, we get
        $$
        A \cdot 12^2 \approx 6
        $$
        (in more detail,
        $$
        %(A\cdot 12^2) - (A\cdot 0^2) \approx 6
        A\cdot 12^2 - A\cdot 0^2 \approx 6
        $$
        but $A\cdot 0^2$ goes away), meaning
        $$
        A \approx {6\over 12^2} = {1\over 24}
        $$
        meaning that the quadratic portion of the function is
        $$
        {x^2\over 24} - 3
        $$
        per this estimate.

        The other portion of the answer—what is left
        after the parabola is subtracted—is a cosine-like
        function (or _sinusoid_) whose amplitude (the
        height of a bump) is roughly $0.5$, which is half the
        amplitude of
        sine/cosine:

        |> Image
            style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_minus_cos_20x_plus_quadratic_with_inset.svg

        Moreover at $x = 0$ we find
        more or less exactly
        the _bottom_ of a
        bump,
        so altogether
        we can use a function of the form
        $$
        -0.5\cos(Bx)
        $$
        to model this sinusoid,
        where the multiplication by $0.5$ gives us
        the desired amplitude and where the ‘$-$’ gives
        us an anti-bump (“trough”?) instead of a bump at $x = 0$;
        on the other hand the value $B$ will control the amount of
        horizontal compression inside the curve; specifically,
        $$
        B = 1
        $$
        will give a curve that goes through one full cycle
        per interval of length $4\eta$,
        while, in general, an arbitrary value of $B$ will give a
        curve that goes $B$ full cycles
        per interval of length $4\eta$ (the larger $B$ is,
        the more “frenzied” the curve);
        in our case, it seems that $B \approx 20$:

        |> Image
            style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cosine_minus_cos_20x_plus_quadratic_B_estimate.svg

        So an estimate for the
        second function
        would be...
        $$
        -0.5\cos(20x)
        $$
        ...giving us...
        $$
        -0.5\cos(20x) + {x^2\over 24} - 3
        $$
        ...for our final answer, after adding the parabola back.

|> Exercise

    Guesstimate a function with this graph:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave.svg

    |> Solution

        First we estimate a function for the large-scale
        curve in purple:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_purple.svg

        It appears to be a linear function (line through
        $(0, 0)$ sloping down) plus a sinusoid. To
        estimate the slope of the linear function we can
        take two points in like relation to the sinusoid,
        draw a line between them and estimate the slope:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_purple_blue_with_1_4.svg

        This makes the linear function portion of the purple
        curve

        $$
        y = -{1\over 4}x
        $$

        or thereabouts.

        To model the sinusoid portion of the large-scale
        purple curve we need more measurements, such as
        the total height of the sinusoid from top of
        bump to bottom of trough; we can add a third “bottom
        of trough” dot, in same relation to the top of
        bumps (but we won't actually draw this dot or else
        we won't be able to see where we're measuring):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_purple_blue_with_height.svg

        So it appears that the sinusoid has a total height
        of $\approx 4$ from top of bump to bottom of trough.

        (And in case you're confused by what we're trying
        to do,
        let us re-explain that we are trying
        to measure the vertical width of this blue band...

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_purple_blue_with_band.svg

        ...that, indeed, seems near $4$.)

        What this means is that if we remove the linear
        portion

        $$
        y = -{1\over 4}x
        $$

        from the purple curve, what we will find is a
        sinusoid whose individual bumps have height $\approx 2$;
        something like this (we switch the color to aquamarine, so
        that “purple curve” retains its unique meaning):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_purple_sinusoid_only.svg

        This graph has the form
        $$
        y = -2\sin(Bx)
        $$
        for some value of $B \in \rr$ that, chosen correctly,
        will give us the desired “wavelength”. (Note that
        $$
        y = -\sin(x)
        $$
        has graph...

        |> Image
            style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_minus_sin_x.svg

        ...and that
        $$
        y = -2\sin(x)
        $$
        has graph...

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_minus_2sin_x.svg

        ...and, from there, all that remains is to
        “slow down” the oscillation to match the
        aquamarine graph—the “slowing down” is what
        $B$ is for.)

        To know how much $B$ must be, we must measure
        the cycle length (it is, admittedly, hard to
        accurately determine the position of the top
        of each large-scale bump, but we do our best by
        basing ourselves off of what appear to be identical
        patterns in the small-scale oscillations at
        the top of each large-scale bump):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_purple_blue_period_measurement.svg

        As

        $$
        12.6 \approx 12.56 = 2\times 6.28 \approx 2\cdot 4\eta
        $$

        the period of the large-scale sinusoid is near
        twice the period of sin or cos; i.e., we need to
        “slow down”

        $$
        -2\sin(x)
        $$

        by a factor $2$, i.e., put

        $$
        B = 0.5
        $$

        i.e., use

        $$
        y = -2\sin(0.5x)
        $$

        for the large-scale sinusoid. (Aquamarine graph.)

        (So far we have

        $$
        -{1\over 4}x - 2\sin(0.5x)
        $$

        for our approximation to the purple curve, putting
        the linear and sinusoidal parts together. Now we
        move on from the purple curve.)

        It remains to add in the small-scale oscillation
        from the original curve; we can do the tedious
        part first, and count the number cycles in an
        interval of length $4\eta \approx 6.28$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_wave_purple_small_scale_bump_count.svg

        So the small-scale oscillation is running
        at $\approx 19$ times the frequency of an ordinary
        sine or cosine, and we can model the small-scale
        oscillation by

        $$
        x \ra -0.5\sin(19x)
        $$

        since, like the large-scale oscillation from the
        purple curve, it shares the same phase as $-\sin(x)$,
        and since, like the small-scale oscillation from
        Exercise 3, it has an amplitude of $\approx 0.5$.

        Altogether, we get

        $$
        y = -{1\over 4}x - 2\sin(0.5x) - 0.5\sin(19x)
        $$

        as our “guesstimate”, while adding the linear
        function, the large-scale sinusoid, and the small-scale
        sinusoid together.

            It is, indeed, intriguing that all of these

|> Exercise
    Is the pythagorean identity apparent in the

    |> Solution

        Yes.
        Imagine two wooden cutouts made
        from the graphs of $y = \sin^2(x)$, $y = \cos^2(x)$:

        |> Image
            style=margin-top:1.1em;margin-bottom:1.1em;

        After vertically flipping the cutout
        of $y = \cos^2(x)$, the cutouts
        fit together to make
        the constant function $y = 1$ (like a parquet):

        And this occurs because
        $$
        \cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1
        $$
        for all $x \in \rr$, which is the pythagorean identity.

|> Exercise

    Compute the ratio $A/B$ assuming all same-colored
    triangles are similar, with the help of a calculator:

    |> Image
        style=width:500px;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_snail.svg

    |> Solution

        What we want is the multiplicative ratio that
        would take us from the bottom to the top side of
        this quadrilateral, so that we can multiply by that
        ratio over and over again:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_snail_quad.svg

        But the two triangles involved are

        _|NOT RIGHT TRIANGLES|_

        and we must break them into smaller parts that
        _are_ right triangles in order to use trigonometric
        functions. Specifically, as per this drawing:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_snail_quad_four_parts.svg

        The multiplicative ratios that correspond to the
        first and third arrows (in arrow-order from bottom
        to top) are

        $$
        \sin(68^\circ\hlfbk)
        $$
        $$
        \sin(59^\circ\hlfbk)
        $$

        because these are “hypotenuse-to-opposite” arrows,
        while the multiplicative ratios that correspond to the
        second and fourth arrows are

        $$
        \csc(71^\circ\hlfbk)
        $$
        $$
        \csc(60^\circ\hlfbk)
        $$

        because these are the opposite (no pun intended),
        i.e.,“opposite-to-hypotenuse” arrows. The “big grey
        arrow” ratio from two diagrams ago is obtained by multiplying
        these four small-arrow ratios together, or

        $$
        \sin(68^\circ\hlfbk)\times\csc(71^\circ\hlfbk)\times\sin(59^\circ\hlfbk)\times\csc(60^\circ\hlfbk)
        $$

        (that can also be written

        $$
        {\sin(68^\circ\hlfbk)\times\sin(59^\circ\hlfbk) \over \sin(71^\circ\hlfbk)\times\sin(60^\circ\hlfbk)}
        $$

        because $\csc = {1\over \sin}$) which, numerically, comes out to

        $$
        0.97057870529467...
        $$

        meaning that the top side of the quadrilateral tile is

        $$
        97\%
        $$

        and some the length of the bottom side; taking
        the $36$-th power of $0.9705\dots$, because $36$ is the
        number of times that the quadrilateral
        repeats within the spiral, we find

        $$
        0.34127722635785...
        $$

        which is the desired ratio $A/B$, and which agrees with the
        drawing, as $A$ seems plausibly to be about one-third of
        $B$, from the drawing!

        |> SolutionNote

            While the final answer can be written

            $$
            (\sin(68^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot\csc(71^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot\sin(59^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot\csc(60^\circ\hlfbk))^{36}
            $$

            or

            $$
            \left({\sin(68^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot\sin(59^\circ\hlfbk) \over \sin(71^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot\sin(60^\circ\hlfbk)}\right)^{\!36}
            $$

            teachers typically want to see such expressions
            evualuated out, to make sure that you and your
            calculator form a good team. (And, to be fair,
            catching one's own calculator mistakes by virtue
            of spotting a nonsensical number is a skill in
            itself.)

        |> SolutionNote

            Instead of counting the number of times that the
            quadrilateral appears in the double spiral by hand
            one can
            calculate the amount of rotation between one
            quadrilateral and the next, which is this purple angle:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_snail_quad_purple_angle_1.svg

            The key to measuring this
            angle is the concept of an “alternating angle”,
            whereby $68^\circ$ reappears to the left of $71^\circ$,
            here:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_snail_quad_purple_angle_2.svg

            Then we can calculate the purple angle as

            $$
            68^\circ + 71^\circ + 61^\circ - 180^\circ = 20^\circ
            $$

            meaning that each quadrilateral is rotated by $20^\circ$ from the
            previous, and in one turn of the spiral there are

            $$
            {360^\circ\over 20^\circ} = 18
            $$

            quadrilaterals, or

            $$
            2 \times 18 = 36
            $$

            quadrilaterals for two turns!

            is the vector going from the head of $\vec{u}$ to
            the tail of $\vec{v}$ in the afore-mentioned

|> Exercise

    If a particle in $\rr^2$ (= “in the plane”)
    has $x$-coordinate
    $$
    A\cdot\cos(Bt + C) + D
    $$
    at time $t$ what is the most likely motion
    that the particle is undergoing? In that
    case, what is the geometric meaning of the
    constants $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$?

    |> Solution

        The simplest motion that would produce such
        an $x$-coordinate (according to subjective human
        standards of simplicity, admittedly) is circular
        motion at uniform speed. In this case:

        |> TextParent
            |> ul
                style=list-style-type:disc;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;padding-left:66px;line-height:1.7em;
                |> li

                    $A$ is the radius of the circle
                |> li

                    $D$ is the $x$-coordinate of the circle's center

        And either:

        |> TextParent
            |> ul
                style=list-style-type:disc;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;padding-left:66px;line-height:1.7em;
                |> li

                    $B$ is the counterclockwise
                    _angular speed_/_angular frequency_ (radians per
                    unit time) and $C$ is the counterclockwise
                    starting angle ($t = 0$) of the particle, as
                    measured from a translate of the positive $x$
                    axis going through the center of the circle

        Or:

        |> TextParent
            |> ul
                style=list-style-type:disc;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;padding-left:66px;line-height:1.7em;
                |> li

                    $-B$ is the counterclockwise
                    angular speed/angular frequency of the particle
                    and $-C$ is the counterclockwise starting angle
                    of the particle, as measured from a translate of
                    the positive $x$ axis going through the center
                    of the circle

        In more detail, every time

        $$
        t
        $$

        increases by $1$,

        $$
        Bt + C
        $$

        increases by $B$, but

        $$
        Bt + C
        $$

        is an amount of radians, because anything
        fed to ‘cos’ is an amount of radians; and so
        $B$ ends up being the

        __radian increase per unit time,__

        or angular speed, of the particle.

        However, said “increase” in radians can be
        associated to either clockwise or a
        counterclockwise motion, there is no telling.
        (Quite aside from the fact that $B$ might be
        negative.) Indeed, while we have a tendency to
        think of $\cos(x)$ as

        __the $x$-coordinate of a point $x$ units
        |> br
        counterclockwise from $(1, 0)$ on the unit circle__

        $\cos(x)$ is also

        __the $x$-coordinate of a point $x$ units
        |> br
        clockwise from $(1, 0)$ on the unit circle__

        [“counterclockwise” $\ra$ “clockwise”].
        Per the one interpretation of ‘cos’,

        $$
        Bt + C
        $$

        is an amount of counterclockwise radians; per
        the other,

        $$
        Bt + C
        $$

        is an amount of _clockwise_ radians. The following
        diagram illustrates the two possibilities:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_Bt_plus_C_OccamsRazor_combined_clockwise_version.svg

        (Or... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_Bt_plus_C_OccamsRazor_combined_counterclockwise_version.svg

        ...to put everything in terms of
        counterclockwise-ness.) This accounts for
        the two solutions listed above. (But it can
        only be one of those two solutions, having made
        the “Occam's razor” assumption that the
        particle is traveling at uniform speed around
        a circle.) (Nb: In particular, “uniform speed”
        precludes sudden reversals of direction at either
        end of the circle, if you were at all thinking
        of that, for speed would be undefined at
        those points where direction is reversed.)

        |> SolutionNote

            If you harbor any doubts about there being no more
            than two solutions, picture this diagram...

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_Bt_plus_C_black_on_white.svg

            ...and imagine the vertical line scanning
            to the left and to the right again as it
            tracks the $x$-coordinate of a particle going
            around the circle, unseen. Then there is one
            clockwise particle that tracks with the line,
            and one counterclockwise particle that tracks
            with the line, but no more, insofar as
            non-direction-reversing particles are
            concerned!

|> Exercise

    Take a particle traveling around a
    circle at constant speed. What is the
    number of cycles [full revolutions] per
    $4\eta$ units of time equal to, by
    another name?

    |> Solution

        Let

        $$
        x
        $$

        be the number of cycles per $4\eta$ units
        of time.

        Since one cycle is $4\eta$ radians, we can,
        instead of saying that the particle travels

        __$x$ cycles per $4\eta$ units of time__

        say that the particle travels

        __$x\cdot 4\eta{}$ radians per $4\eta$ units of time__

        or that the particle travels

        __$x$ radians per $1$ unit of time__

        dividing by $4\eta$. In other words, $x$ is the so-called

        __angular speed__

        or

        __angular frequency__

        of the particle. (That's the answer: “angular
        speed”, or, equivalently, “angular frequency”.)

    What geometric ratios do

    $$
    \eta
    $$

    and

    $$
    4\eta
    $$

    represent?

    |> Solution

        While $\eta$ was defined
        as the quarter-circumference of a unit circle,
        more generally,

        $$
        \eta
        $$

        is the quarter-circumference of a circle (any
        circle) divided by its radius, and, correspondingly,

        $$
        4\eta
        $$

        is the circumference of a circle (any circle)
        divided by its radius.

        |> SolutionNote

            As one consequence, it follows that the circumference
            of a circle is

            $$
            4\eta\cdot r
            $$

            where $r$ is the radius.

        |> SolutionNote

            These “ratio descriptions” of $\eta$ and
            $4\eta$ also follow by viewing $\eta$ and $4\eta$
            as the radian values of a right angle and a full angle,
            respectively.

        Here is the division in American notation
        overlayed on top of a “Plaza” wallpaper to

        digits (in American notation each column
        of digits is associated to a power of $10$,
        with both the numerator and the quotient
        [the result] living inside the same set of
        columns, and only the denominator living
        outside, in a time-space porthole of its own):

        |> Image

        The division stops when we see the same
        remainder twice—here ‘$40$’ reappears, which
        means that the next digit of the quotient
        will be $5$ (like the second digit of the
        quotient, that we obtained back when we had
        a remainder of $40$), the next one $7$ (the
        third digit of the quotient), etc—digits will
        repeat and the “final” quotient when we let
        the division unravel infinitely far to the right
        will be

        ‘$10^0$’ column.

            If you've never done this kind of thing before, the
            division starts in this blank state:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.4em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_1.svg

            We take the first digit of the numerator,
            which is ‘$1$’, ask “how many times does
            $7$ go into $1$?”, we will write the answer
            here:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_2a.svg

            The answer is ‘$0$’ ($7$ goes $0$ times into $1$):

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_2b.svg

            We next add a digit from the numerator, giving
            us $11$, we ask “how many times does $7$ go into
            $11$?”, we will write the answer here:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_3a.svg

            The answer is ‘$1$’ ($7$ goes $1$ times into $11$):

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_3b.svg

            We subtract

            |> div
                style=font-size:1.65em;margin:1em 0;

                $$
                1 \times 7
                $$

            from $11$, giving us a new remainder
            of $4$ (the very first “remainder” is actually $11$,
            before anything starts) (before anything started we
            had $11 = 7 \times 0 + 11$, and now we have
            $11 = 7 \times 1 + 4$):

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_4.svg

            Because $7$ does not fit into $4$ (and if it did,
            we would have done something wrong)
            we “bring down a $0$” that is actually part of
            a hidden sequence of $0$'s sitting to the right
            of $11$:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_5.svg

            We ask “how many times does $7$ go into $40$?”,
            we will write the answer here:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_6a.svg

            The answer is ‘$5$’ ($7$ goes $5$ times into $40$):

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_6b.svg

            We subtract

            |> div
                style=font-size:1.65em;margin:1em 0;

                $$
                5\times 7
                $$

            from $40$, giving us a new remainder
            of $5$
            (well, to be technical, the remainder is actually
            $5 \times 10^{-1}$, not $5$, but
            the teacher at the board will often say “$5$”):

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_7.svg

            Because $7$ does not fit into $5$, we bring
            another $0$ down from our infinite reserve of
            $0$'s:

            |> Image
                style=margin-top:0.8em;margin-bottom:1.5em;
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_11_over_7_longhand_eloise_start_8.svg

            (Etc.)

    {22\over 7}, \,\,\,\,\, {33\over 7}, \,\,\,\,\,\rm{and}\,\,\,\,\,{44\over 7}
    $$
    by hand using long division.

    |> Solution

        The divisions, pursued up to the point where
        remainders repeat, look as follows:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_22_and_33_and_44_over_7_combined_longhands.svg

        From which...

        $$
        \displaylines{
        \Large \up{1.5}{22\over 7} = 3.\overline{142857}\\
        \Large \up{1.7}{33\over 7} = 4.\overline{714285}\\
        \Large \up{1.7}{44\over 7} = 6.\overline{285714}
        }
        $$

        ...because the digits of the quotient are,
        in each case, about to
        restart from the first digit
        after the decimal point.

        |> SolutionNote

            Because...

            $$
            \displaylines{
            \Large         \eta  \approx{11\over 7}\\
            \Large \up{1.7}2\eta \approx{22\over 7}\\
            \Large \up{1.7}3\eta \approx{33\over 7}\\
            \Large \up{1.7}4\eta \approx{44\over 7}
            }
            $$

            ...we thus have...

            $$
            \displaylines{
            \Large         \eta \approx  1.\overline{571428}\\
            \Large \up{1.7}2\eta \approx 3.\overline{142857}\\
            \Large \up{1.7}3\eta \approx 4.\overline{714285}\\
            \Large \up{1.7}4\eta \approx 6.\overline{285714}}
            $$

            ...though none of these estimates are actually
            accurate to more than two decimal places. (While all
            are accurate up to _at least_ two decimal places.)

        |> SolutionNote

            As mentioned in Note 1 of Exercise 24,
            Chapter 3, these approximations are about
            half-a-part-in-a-thousand too large, or to
            be more exact,

            $$
            \approx 0.0004
            $$

            too large in relative terms. I.e., you can subtract

            $$
            \approx 1.\overline{571428} \cdot 0.0004 \approx 0.0006
            $$

            from

            $$
            \approx 1.\overline{571428}
            $$

            to get a better approximation for $\eta$, subtract

            $$
            \approx 3.\overline{142857} \cdot 0.0004 \approx 0.0012
            $$

            from

            $$
            \approx 3.\overline{142857}
            $$

            to get a better approximation for $2\eta$, subtract

            $$
            \approx 4.\overline{714285} \cdot 0.0004 \approx 0.0019
            $$

            from

            $$
            \approx 4.\overline{714285}
            $$

            to get a better approximation for $3\eta$, subtract

            $$
            \approx 6.\overline{285714} \cdot 0.0004 \approx 0.0025
            $$

            from

            $$
            \approx 6.\overline{285714}
            $$

            to get a better approximation for $4\eta$. The resulting
            approximations end up being...

            $$
            \displaylines{
            \Large         \eta \approx  1.5708\\
            \Large \up{1.7}2\eta \approx 3.1416\\
            \Large \up{1.7}3\eta \approx 4.7123\\
            \Large \up{1.7}4\eta \approx 6.2832}
            $$

            ...that are correct approximations up to
            the fourth digit, it turns out, modulo
            rounding off of the fifth digit. (But these
            are not worth learning by heart, by any means.)

|> Exercise

    To close our division skills: use the
    table below to compute the integer part and
    the first three digits past the decimal point
    (no rounding based on the fourth digit) of

    $$
    15542486476949/777
    $$

    by hand, using long division. What is the
    new (last) remainder when the quotient reaches
    the 3rd digit after the decimal point, and what
    equation is implied from the quotient and the
    new (last) remainder at that point?

    $$
    \begin{array}{c|cc}
    \up{1}\dn{0.5} n            &amp;\,1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9 \\ \hline
    \up{1}\dn{0.5} n \cdot 777\,&amp;\,777&amp;1554&amp;2331&amp;3108&amp;3885&amp;4662&amp;5439&amp;6216&amp;6993
    \\
    \end{array}
    $$

    |> Solution

        Here is the long division, pursued up to
        the “$10^{-3}$” column of the quotient,
        including one last remainder computation
        that occurs pursuant to adding the digit in
        the “$10^{-3}$” column of the quotient (this
        is what the problem statement refers to as
        the “last remainder”):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division.svg

        Said quotient is

        $$
        20003200099.033
        $$

        while the new (last) remainder is

        $$
        0.359
        $$

        and the equation linking the two is

        $$
        15542486476949 = 777 \times 20003200099.033 + 0.359
        $$

        per properties of the long division algorithm.

        |> SolutionNote

            Lest anyone get left behind, we can go
            over the division “on the board”
            for a bit.

            We start by asking “how many times does $777$
            go into $1$?”, the answer will go here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_1.svg

            The answer is $0$ (that we need not write
            down, but we can), we move to asking
            “how many times does $777$
            go into $15$?”, the answer will go here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_2.svg

            The answer is $0$, we move to asking
            “how many times does $777$
            go into $155$?”, the answer will go here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_3.svg

            The answer is $0$, we move to asking
            “how many times does $777$
            go into $1554$?”, the answer will go here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_4.svg

            The answer is $2$, we subtract $2 \times 777$
            from $1554$, giving us a new “prefix” for
            the remainder:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_4b.svg

            (FYI, the remainder now consists of these yellow
            digits:)

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_4remainder.svg

            Continuing, we bring down a $2$, ask “how many times does $777$
            go into $2$?”, the answer will go here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_5b_v2.svg

            The answer is $0$; we bring down a $4$, ask “how many
            times does $777$ go into $24$?”, the answer will go
            here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_6b_v2.svg

            The answer is $0$; we bring down an $8$, ask “how many
            times does $777$ go into $248$?”, the answer will go
            here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_7b_v2.svg

            The answer is $0$; we bring down a $6$, ask “how many
            times does $777$ go into $2486$?”, the answer will go
            here:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_8b_v2.svg

            The answer is $3$, we subtract $3 \times 777$
            from $2648$, giving us a new remainder:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_8c.svg

            (And to be specific, the remainder is now formed
            by...

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_inside_8remainder.svg

            ...these yellow digits.) Etc.

        |> SolutionNote

            If you need help brushing up on your
            long-form subtraction, say your subtraction is this:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_a.svg

            You can either treat the top or bottom number as an
            odometer, and count how much a car with this
            odometer must be driven back/forth to reach the other
            number.

            Viewing the top number as an odometer, the odometer
            would be as follows:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_odometer_1.svg

            Starting from the right end of the subtraction, we ask
            “by how much (or how little) does a car need to be
            driven backwards, to turn the ‘$2$’ into an ‘$8$’?”, we
            will write the answer below:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_c.svg

            The answer is: $4$ [miles*] (*say):

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_d.svg

            But the odometer will pass
            from ‘$0$’ to ‘$9$’ on its way down to $8$, so we also
            turn the ‘$6$’ into a ‘$5$’ (or “borrow a $10$” to do
            $12 - 8 = 4$, as some teachers put it):

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_e.svg

            Next we ask “by how many [$10$s of miles] does the car need
            to be driven back, to turn the ‘$5$’ into a ‘$9$’?”, we
            will write the answer below:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_f.svg

            The answer is: $6$ [$10$s of miles]:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_g.svg

            But here too the odometer will pass
            from ‘$0$’ to ‘$9$’ as we reduce it, so the wheel to its
            left must be turned back a notch as well; and because that
            wheel is a ‘$0$’ already, the wheel to _its_left
            must be turned back a notch; and so on, resulting in a small cascade
            effect:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_h.svg

            Next we ask “by how many [$100$s of miles] does the car need
            to be driven back, to turn the ‘$9$’ into a ‘$0$’?”, we
            will write the answer below:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_i.svg

            The answer is: $9$ [$100$s of miles]:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_big_division_big_subtraction_j.svg

            Next we ask “by how many [$1000$s of miles] does the car need
            to be driven back, to turn the ‘$9$’ into a ‘$5$’?”:

            |> Image

            The answer is: $4$ [$1000$s of miles]:

            (And like we alluded to above, one can also
            consider the bottom number to be the odometer,
            and “count up” towards the top number, leading
            to a symmetric algorithm, but one method is not
            better than the other.)

            Generally,

            at any point in a long division after the
            remainder is updated to account for a new term
            added to the quotient. That's what the remainder
            is for: to satisfy this equation!

|> Exercise

    What is the angle marked ‘?’, as a function
    of $\theta$?

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_angle_sum_180.svg

    |> Solution

        It is $\eta - \theta$. (Since...

        $$
        \theta + (\eta - \theta) + \eta = 2\eta
        $$

        ...you know that's the right answer!) (Nb: $2\eta = 180^\circ$.)

        |> SolutionNote

            Two angles that sum to $\eta$ are
            called _complementary_, with each angle being
            the _complement_ of the other.
            The two
            non-right angles of a right triangle are,
            therefore, complementary!
            (Not

            __complimentary__

            which would indicate that the angles are
            given to you for free—everything in math is
            free, not just those angles!)

|> Exercise

    The graph $y = \cos(x) + \sin(x)$ from
    Exercise 5 has a maximum value greater than
    $1$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_maximum_of_sin_plus_cos.svg

    What is this maximum value, and for which
    value(s) of $x$ is it achieved?

    |> Solution

        The sum

        $$
        x + y
        $$

        where

        $$
        (x, y)
        $$

        is a point in $\rr^2$ can be understood as a
        certain vertical displacement added to a
        certain horizontal displacement, but where
        the sum is numerical. (Not vectorial.)
        To realize the sum geometrically we must
        either align the vertical displacement to be
        horizontal, or else align the horizontal
        displacement to be vertical:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_x_plus_y_options.svg
            style=background-color:#fdfdfd

        Either way, the upshot is that the sum

        $$
        x + y
        $$

        can be found as the intersection of a line of
        angle $-45^\circ$ through the point $(x, y)$
        with either the $x$- or $y$-axis:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_x_plus_y_intersections.svg

        (By the way: when we say “line of angle
        $-45^\circ$” we refer to the standard position
        of $-45^\circ$ on the unit circle, and, more
        specifically, to a line that is parallel
        to a line going through $(0, 0)$ and that standard
        position.)

        To add a little imagery, if we make a heatmap
        of $\rr^2$ according to the value of the coordinate
        sum...

        $$
        x + y
        $$

        ...over all points $(x, y)$ we will obtain diagonal
        bands of slope $-1$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_x_plus_y_rainbow.svg

        If we are confined to some region of the plane
        and we need to find a point that maximizes the
        coordinate sum we must go as far up and to the
        right as possible, towards brown—whereas
        to minimize the sum we must go as far down and
        to the left as possible, towards purple!

        Having said this,

        $$
        \cos(x) + \sin(x)
        $$

        can be interpreted as the sum of the $x$- and
        $y$-coordinates of the point

        $$
        (\cos(x), \sin(x))
        $$

        that is a point on the unit circle. In other words,
        the unit circle is “the region of the plane” (cf.
        previous paragraph) to which we are confined—we
        must choose a value of $x$ that puts us as far
        “up and to the right” as possible on the circle.
        That value is... $x = \eta/2$ (!!!!):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_x_plus_y_eta_over_2.svg

        ...or with any multiple of $4\eta$ added,
        making the set of solutions $x$ actually equal to

        $$
        \Large \{\eta/2 + 4\eta{}k : k \in \zz\}
        $$

        (to be read “$\eta/2$ plus any multiple of $4\eta$”)
        (*or: “the _set of_ values of the form $\eta/2$,
        plus any multiple of $4\eta$”).

        The actual value of $\cos(x) + \sin(x)$ achieved
        at this point is

        $$
        \Large
        \begin{align}
        &amp;\,\, \cos(\eta/2) + \sin(\eta/2)\\ =&\,\,\up{1.5}  \sqrt{0.5} + \sqrt{0.5}\\ =&\,\,\up{1.5} \sqrt{2}
        \end{align}
        $$

        using the fact that

        |> div

            $$
            \Large \cos(\eta/2) = \sin(\eta/2) = \sqrt{0.5}
            $$

        and that

        $$
        \Large \sqrt{0.5} = {\sqrt{2} \over 2}
        $$

        (cf. Exercise 1, Chapter 1).

        |> SolutionNote

            The fact that

            $$
            \Large \cos(\eta/2) + \sin(\eta/2) = \sqrt{2}
            $$

            can also be seen from this diagram...

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_x_plus_y_pythagoras.svg

            ...which is an application of the Pythagorean
            theorem. (In the above, $x_0 = \cos(\eta/2)$,
            $y_0 = \sin(\eta/2)$, and the sum is seen to be
            $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$.)

        |> SolutionNote

            On the original graph from the statement, the
            $y$-value of the maximum is therefore
            $y = \sqrt{2}$, attained at $x = \eta/2$,
            $x = 9\eta/2$, $x = -7\eta/2$, etc:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_maximum_of_sin_plus_cos_with_answer.svg

            (Note that

            $$
            \Large {\eta\over 2} + 4\eta = {\eta\over 2} + {8\eta\over 2} = {9\eta\over 2}
            $$
            $$
            \Large
            {\eta\over 2} - 4\eta = {\eta\over 2} - {8\eta\over 2} = -{7\eta\over 2}
            $$

            and, in general, the numerators of these fractions
            will be some multiple of $8\eta$ apart.)

|> Exercise

    What is the angle marked ‘?’, as a function of
    $\theta$?

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_angle_sum_180_followup.svg

    |> Solution

        It is $\theta$, as well. One method of
        deduction uses the fact that “the complement
        of my complement is myself”:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_angle_sum_180_followup_explanation.svg

        Another method of deduction uses the fact that,
        together with the angle immediately to its left
        (which happens to be $\eta - \theta$, because
        it is the complement of $\theta$ via the smallest
        right triangle present), the sought-for angle
        makes up $90^\circ$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_angle_sum_180_followup_explanation_2.svg

        (In one case we use the fact that the
        medium-sized triangle is a right triangle,
        in another case that the smallest-size
        triangle is a right triangle—and in both cases
        that the original, largest triangle is a
        right triangle.)

|> Exercise

    Argue that, in the following figure, the
    angle marked ‘?’ equals $\theta$, the angle at
    the center of the circle:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tangent_angle_v2.svg

    |> Solution

        The ending and starting half-lines of the
        angle marked ‘?’ are both $90^\circ$ counterclockwise
        from the ending and starting half-lines,
        respectively, of the central angle:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tangent_angle_explanation_v2.svg

        The angle marked ‘?’ is therefore obtained
        by a $90^\circ$ rotation (and then translation)
        of the central angle, and is, therefore, equal
        to the central angle $\theta$.

        |> SolutionNote

            This holds no matter which quadrant we
            push $\theta$ to:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tangent_angle_explanation_other_quadrants.svg

            Verbalized: _the counterclockwise angle from the positive
            $x$ axis to
            the radial vector
            equals the counterclockwise angle from the positive
            $y$ axis to the counterclockwise tangent._

            (Nb: When we say the “radial vector” and
            “counterclockwise tangent” we mean those objects that
            are illustrated here:)

    If each of these dotted lines...

    $\rt{0.1}$) of the two-variable function

    for $\theta \in \rr$, and specify the set of

    attained.

    |> Solution

        The isosets of

        $$
        (x, y) \ra xy
        $$

        (lambda-notation for a two-variable function)
        have this general appearance (it depends on
        the window and on the exact isosets that
        you choose to  draw—we chose a few
        different random ones):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_xy_isosets.svg

        Note that each isoset consists of the union of TWO
        disjoint curves, except for the isoset

        $$
        xy = 0
        $$

        (or: “the isoset

        $$
        \{(x, y) \in \rr^2 : xy = 0 \}
        $$

        ...” to pedantically indicate that we are
        talking about _a set of points in the plane_),
        that, for its part, cannot be said to consist
        of two _~_~_disjoint_~_~_ curves, because it
        is the union of the $x$- and $y$- axes, that
        intersect.

        (For a throwback, the solution of Exercise
        16 of Chapter 3 mentions that the product of
        two numbers is $0$ if and only if one of the
        numbers is $0$. In our case,

        $$
        xy = 0
        $$

        if and only

        $$
        \,x = 0\,
        $$

        _or_

        $$
        \,y = 0
        $$

        where

        $$
        x = 0
        $$

        happens to be the equation of the $y$ axis, and

        $$
        y = 0
        $$

        happens to be the equation of the $x$ axis, which
        explains the shape of the isoset.)

        If we draw a “heatmap” of

        $$
        xy
        $$

        in some region of the plane, similarly to
        Exercise 18, the larger (more positive)
        values show up in the first and third
        quadrants, while the smaller (more negative)
        values show up in the second and fourth
        quadrants:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_rainbow.svg

        Of particular interest to us: at a given
        distance from the origin, the line

        $$
        x = y
        $$

        can be seen seen to hold the largest of values of $xy$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_fixed_distance.svg

        In particular,

        $$
        \cos\theta\,\sin\theta
        $$

        will reach its maximum at those values of
        $\theta$ that put the point $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$
        at either $(\sqrt{0.5}, \sqrt{0.5})$ or
        $(-\sqrt{0.5}, -\sqrt{0.5})$ on the unit circle;
        these values of $\theta$ are

        $$
        \Large \{0.5\eta + 4\eta{}k : k \in \zz\} \\
        \Large \cup \{2.5\eta + 4\eta{}k : k \in \zz\}\up{1.5}
        $$

        as per this illustration...

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_angles.svg

        ...and the maximum value of

        $$
        \Large \cos\theta\,\sin\theta
        $$

        itself will be

        $$
        \Large \sqrt{0.5} \cdot \sqrt{0.5} = {1\over 2}
        $$

        or

        $$
        \Large (-\sqrt{0.5}) \cdot (-\sqrt{0.5}) = {1\over 2}
        $$

        equivalently; though one should also note
        that

        $$
        \Large \{0.5\eta + 4\eta{}k : k \in \zz\} \cup \{2.5\eta + 4\eta{}k : k \in \zz\} \\ \Large \up{1.5}= \{0.5\eta + 2\eta{}k : k \in \zz\}
        $$

        which is the “clever” way of writing the set
        of $\theta$'s for which the maximum is achieved.

            As a consequence, the function

            discussed in Exercise 4 has maximum value

            $$
            {1\over 2}

            achieved for inputs in the set

            if and only if the point $(2x, y)$ satisfies

            __$(a, b)$-dilation__

            [meaning: a horizontal dilation by a factor
            $a$ followed by a vertical dilation by a
            factor $b$, or vice-versa, the order doesn't
            matter] of the curve

            $$
            xy = 1
            $$

            for all pairs $(a, b)$ such that $ab = C$; for
            example,

            $$
            xy = 3
            $$

            is the

            __$(3, 1)$-dilation__

            [horizontal dilation by factor $3$] of
            $xy = 1$, as it is the

            __$(1, 3)$-dilation__

            [vertical dilation by factor $3$] of $xy = 1$,
            but is also the

            __$(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})$-dilation__

            of $xy = 1$, since $\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3} = 3$, and the

            __$(12, {1\over 4})$-dilation__

            of $xy = 1$, since $12 \cdot {1\over 4} = 3$,
            etc.

            For another specifically noteworthy instance
            of this phenomenon,

            $$
            xy = 1
            $$

            is the

            __$(-1, -1)$-dilation__

            of itself, since $(-1)\cdot(-1) = 1$,
            a fact that is also known as the “central
            symmetry” of $xy = 1$. (You can take this
            last statement as the definition of “centrally
            symmetric”. I.e., a set $S \subseteq \rr^2$
            is centrally symmetric if and only if $S$
            is equal to the $(-1, -1)$-dilation of
            itself.)

            (Indeed, since
            $$
            xy = C
            $$
            if and only if
            $$
            (-x)(-y) = C
            $$
            each of the isosets is centrally symmetric, not only
            $xy = 1$.)

        |> SolutionNote

            Among other additional symmetries, the line
            $$
            x = y
            $$
            is an axis of symmetry of each isoset, meaning
            that each isoset equals its mirror reflection
            about that line:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_mirror_image.svg

            Note that, technically, a set $S \subseteq \rr^2$
            [meaning: $S$ is a set of points in the plane] is
            symmetric about $x = y$ if and only if

            $$
            \Large (x_0, y_0) \in S \iff (y_0, x_0) \in S
            $$

            [read “$(x_0, y_0)$ is in $S$ if and only if
            $(y_0, x_0)$ is in $S$”] for all $(x_0, y_0)$.
            Illustrated:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_mirror_image_with_x0_y0.svg

            In our case, a point $(x_0, y_0)$ is on the curve

            $$
            xy = C
            $$

            if and only if the point $(y_0, x_0)$ is on
            the curve, because $x_0y_0 = y_0x_0$, by
            commutativity of multiplication. This observation
            constitutes the “proof” that each isoset is
            mirror symmetric through $x = y$.

            (Or...
            $$
            \large
            \begin{align}
            \large     &amp; (x_0, y_0) \in \{(x,y)\in \rr^2: xy = C\} \\
            \large\up{1.4} \iff&amp; \,x_0y_0 = C \\
            \large\up{1.4} \iff&amp; \,y_0x_0 = C \\
            \large\up{1.4} \iff&amp; (y_0, x_0) \in \{(x,y)\in \rr^2: xy = C\}
            \end{align}
            $$

            ...to put it over-the-top formally.)

        |> SolutionNote

            Lastly, each isoset is symmetric
            through the line $x = -y$:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_mirror_image_other_way.svg

            Indeed, this symmetry can be obtained as the

            __composition__

            of a symmetry through $x = y$ and a central
            symmetry:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_max_xy_mirror_image_other_way_explanation.svg

            In other words, any set that is symmetric through
            $x = y$ and that is centrally symmetric is also
            symmetric through $x = -y$, so there is nothing “new”
            to prove here, except to make this observation
            about composition!

|> Exercise

    Express $A/B$ as a function of $\theta$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio.svg

    |> Solution

        We shall use the height $C$ of the triangle
        as a stopover between $A$ and $B$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_height_C.svg

        On the one hand, $C/B = \tan(\theta)$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_left_part.svg

        On the other hand, $A/C = \tan(\theta)$
        also, by the result of Exercise 19 (whereby
        $\theta$ reappears as the top left angle of
        the middle-sized right triangle):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_right_part.svg

        The answer is therefore:

        $$
        \tan(\theta)\cdot\tan(\theta) = \tan^2(\theta).
        $$

        (As per the fact that $(A/B) = (C/B)\cdot(A/C)$.)

|> Exercise

    Express $A/B$ as a function of $\theta$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_big_A.svg

    |> Solution

        Here are two solutions:

        |> Pause

        _Solution 1._ We use the small leg $D$
        of the triangle as a stopover between $A$ and
        $B$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_big_A_with_D.svg

        On the one hand, $D/B = \sec(\theta)\,\, (= 1/\cos(\theta))$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_big_A_left_part.svg

        On the other hand, $A/D = \sec(\theta)$, also (!?):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_big_A_right_part_shrunk.svg

        Thus:

        $$
        {A\over B} = {D\over B}\times {A\over D} = \sec(\theta)\cdot \sec(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta).
        $$

        |> StarDivider
            style=margin-top:0.5em;

        _Solution 2._
        We decompose $A$ as $B + A'$
        where $A' = B - A$ is the “old $A$” from
        Exercise 22:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_tan_sq_AB_ratio_big_A_with_Aprime.svg

        We find:

        $$
        {A\over B} = {{B + A'}\over B} = {B\over B} + {A'\over B} = 1 + \tan^2(\theta)
        $$

        ...since

        $$
        {A'\over B} = \tan^2(\theta)
        $$

        by Exercise 22. (The End.)

        |> SolutionNote

            Since the two solutions compute
            answers to the same question,
            one can in particular deduce that

            |> center
                style=margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;

                    $$
                    \sec^2(\theta) = 1 + \tan^2(\theta)
                    $$

            for all $0 < \theta < \eta$, which is
            the range of $\theta$ covered by these
            diagrams. (The same identity holds more
            generally than just those $\theta$'s,
            however.)

|> Exercise

    In general, $\sec(\theta)$ and $\tan(\theta)$
    are defined for all $\theta$ such that

    $$
    \cos(\theta) \ne 0
    $$

    with the definitions being...

    |> center
        style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;
        |> div
            style=display:inline-block;border:1px solid red;padding:1em 1em;

            $$
            \,\tan(\theta) = {\sin(\theta)\over \cos(\theta)}\,
            $$
            $$
            \,\sec(\theta) = {1\over \cos(\theta)}\,
            $$

    ...for all $\theta \in \rr$. (I.e., if the fraction is undefined,
    then the function is undefined.)
    Use these definitions
    to prove that
    $$
    1 + \tan^2(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta)
    $$
    for all
    $\theta \in \dom \tan = \dom \sec$.

    |> Solution

        Let $\theta \in \dom \tan = \dom \sec$. Then
        $$
        \cos(\theta) \ne 0
        $$
        and
        $$
        1 = {\cos(\theta)\over \cos(\theta)} = {\cos^2(\theta)\over \cos^2(\theta)}
        $$
        and, by the definitions,
        $$
        \begin{align}
        1 + \tan^2(\theta)
        \,\,&=\,\, 1 + \left({\sin(\theta)\over \cos(\theta)}\right)^{\!2} \\
        &amp;=\,\, \up{2} {\cos^2(\theta)\over \cos^2(\theta)} + {\sin^2(\theta)\over \cos^2(\theta)} \\
        &amp;=\,\, \up{2} {\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta)\over \cos^2(\theta)} \\
        &amp;=\,\, \up{2} {1\over \cos^2(\theta)} \\
        &amp;=\,\, \up{2} \left({1\over \cos(\theta)}\right)^{\!2} \\
        &amp;=\,\, \up{2} \sec^2(\theta)
        \end{align}
        $$
        using the pythagorean identity in the fourth step.

|> Exercise

    Run the computation of the
    previous exercise backwards, starting with
    $$
    \sec^2(\theta)
    $$
    at the near end, and ending with $$1 + \tan^2(\theta)$$
    at the far end. (No peeking back at the solution of
    that exercise.)

    |> Solution

        Viz:

        |> center
            style=margin:1em 0em;
            |> div
                style=display:inline-block;border:1px solid red;padding:1.2em 1.4em;

                $$
                \begin{align}

                \,\,&=\,\, {1\over \cos^2(\theta)} \\
                &amp;=\,\, \up{2} {\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta)\over \cos^2(\theta)} \\
                &amp;=\,\, \up{2} {\cos^2(\theta)\over \cos^2(\theta)} + {\sin^2(\theta)\over \cos^2(\theta)} \\
                &amp;=\,\, \up{2} 1 + \left({\sin(\theta)\over \cos(\theta)}\right)^{\!2} \\
                &amp;=\,\, \up{2}1 + \tan^2(\theta).
                \end{align}
                $$

        (Ta-daa!) (It's slightly harder in this
        direction, when you have to think of
        turning the “$1$” into “$\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta)$”,
        instead of the other way around.)

|> Exercise

    Here are four function compositions
    depicted as “function box” diagrams, with

|> Exercise
    t=tt

    Given the graphs $y = \cos(x)\sin(x)$ and
    $y = \cos^2(x)$...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sinxcosx_and_cos2_comparison.svg

    ...it _appears_ that one graph is a
    translate of the other; if this were
    really so, what would the exact amounts
    of translation be? (Vertical _&_ horizontal.)
    What algebraic identity would this imply? How to
    prove this identity?

    |> Solution

        We know from Exercise 21 that the
        bump immediately to the right of $(0, 0)$
        on the graph $y = \cos(x)\sin(x)$ has
        coordinates $(\eta/2, 0.5)$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sinxcosx_and_cos2_comparison_sinxcosx_max.svg

        It might therefore be that a translation
        of $-\eta/2$ units horizontally and
        ${1\over 2}$ units vertically maps the graph
        $y = \sin(x)\cos(x)$ onto the graph
        $y = \cos^2(x)$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sinxcosx_and_cos2_comparison_zoomed_in.svg

        If true, this would indicate that

        |> center
            style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;
            |> div
                style=border:1px solid red;padding:1em 1em;width:fit-content;

                $$
                \cos^2(x) = {1\over 2} + \cos(x + \eta/2)\sin(x + \eta/2)
                $$

        since replacing “$x$” by “$x + \eta/2$”
        in $\sin(x)\cos(x)$ effects horizontal
        translation of the graph by $-\eta/2$,
        while adding ${1\over 2}$ to the result
        effects a vertical translation by ${1\over 2}$.

        To prove formula we use the angle-sum formulas;
        specifically...

        $$
        \cos(A + B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A)\sin(B)
        $$
        $$
        \sin(A + B) = \cos(A)\sin(B) + \sin(A)\cos(B)
        $$

        ...(in case you had forgotten those); since
        $$
        \,\cos(\eta/2) = \sin(\eta/2) = \sqrt{0.5},
        $$
        we find:
        $$
        \begin{align*}
        \cos(x + \eta/2) &= \cos(x)\cos(\eta/2) - \sin(x)\sin(\eta/2) \\
        &= \up{1.6}\sqrt{0.5}\cdot(\cos(x) - \sin(x))
        \end{align*}
        $$
        and:
        $$
        \begin{align*}
        \sin(x + \eta/2) &= \cos(x)\sin(\eta/2) + \sin(x)\cos(\eta/2) \\
        &= \up{1.6}\sqrt{0.5}\cdot(\cos(x) + \sin(x))
        \end{align*}
        $$
        ...from which the product...
        $$
        \cos(x + \eta/2)\sin(x + \eta/2)
        $$
        ...becomes...
        $$
        \begin{align*}
        &\sqrt{0.5}\cdot\sqrt{0.5}\cdot(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)) \\
        \up{1.6} =\,\,&{1\over 2}\cdot(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)) \\
        \up{1.6} =\,\,&{1\over 2}\cdot(\cos^2(x) - (1 - \cos^2(x))) \\
        \up{1.6} =\,\,&{1\over 2}\cdot(2\cos^2(x) - 1) \\
        \up{1.6} =\,\,&\cos^2(x) - {1\over 2} \\
        \end{align*}
        $$
        ...by the difference-of-squares formula and
        the pythagorean identity (often used together),
        and adding ${1\over 2}$ gives $\cos^2(x)$, Q.E.D.!
        (So $y = \cos^2(x)$ truly is the translate of
        $y = \cos(x)\sin(x)$, _&_ vice-versa.)

        |> SolutionNote

            We can turn the identity around, mapping
            $y = \cos^2(x)$ onto $y = \sin(x)\cos(x)$ via a
            translation, instead of the other way around; this gives:

            |> center
                style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;
                |> div
                    style=border:1px solid red;padding:1em 1em;width:fit-content;

                    $$
                    \,- {1\over 2} + \cos^2(x - \eta/2) = \cos(x)\sin(x).
                    $$

            In more detail: replacing
            “$x$” by “$x - \eta/2$” in $\cos^2(x)$ effects
            horizontal translation by $+\eta/2$, and adding
            $-{1\over 2}$
            to the result effects a vertical translation by $-{1\over 2}$.
            (I.e., we are using the
            inverse amounts of translation that we used to map
            $y = \cos(x)\sin(x)$ onto $y = \cos^2(x)$.)

        |> SolutionNote

            The identity from the previous note can also
            be proved via the angle-sum formulas; since
            $$
            \cos(A + B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A)\sin(B)
            $$
            and
            $$
            \sin(-\eta/2) = -\sqrt{0.5}
            $$
            we have
            $$
            \begin{align*}
            \cos(x - \eta/2) &= \cos(x)\cos(-\eta/2) - \sin(x)\sin(-\eta/2) \\
            \up{1.6} &=\,\, \cos(x)\sqrt{0.5} - \sin(x)(-\sqrt{0.5}) \\

            \end{align*}
            $$
            from which
            $$
            \cos^2(x - \eta/2)
            $$
            becomes
            $$
            \begin{align*}
            &\left(\sqrt{0.5}\cdot(\cos x + \sin x)\right)^2 \\
            \up{1.6} =\,\,&{1\over 2}\cdot(\cos^2 x + 2\cos x\sin x +  \sin^2 x) \\
            \up{1.6} =\,\,&{1\over 2}\cdot(1 + 2\cos x\sin x) \\
            \up{1.6} =\,\,&{1\over 2} + \cos(x)\sin(x) \\
            \end{align*}
            $$
            using the pythagorean identity in the third equality,
            and
            $$
            \begin{align*}
            & -{1\over 2} + \cos^2(x - \eta/2) \\

            \up{1.7} =\,\,&\cos(x)\sin(x)
            \end{align*}
            $$
            as claimed.

|> Exercise
    t=tt

    It also seems from the graphs that $y = \cos^2(x)$
    is a _sinusoid_, i.e., some combination of a
    scaling and translation of $y = \cos(x)$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cos_and_cos2_comparison.svg

    If so, what scaling and translation operations,
    more exactly, can be conjectured to relate the
    two graphs? Can you prove this geometric relationship
    by algebra?

    |> Solution

        Since $\cos^2$ is periodic mod $2\eta$ while
        $\cos$ is periodic mod $4\eta$,
        we need, at the very least, a horizontal compression by
        a factor $2$ in order to map the bumps of $y = \cos(x)$
        onto those of $y = \cos^2(x)$. From there we have to
        readjust the range and amplitude of the curve, such as,
        e.g., by translating up by $1$ and scaling vertically
        by ${1\over 2}$ (or scaling vertically by ${1\over 2}$
        and translating up by ${1\over 2}$, either way):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cos_and_cos2_comparison_transformations_1.svg

        Algebraically, the three steps above turn
        $\cos(x)$ into $\cos(2x)$, into $1 + \cos(2x)$,
        into ${1 + \cos(2x)\over 2}$:

        $$
        \Large\cos(x)
        $$
        $$
        \Large\downarrow
        $$

        \Large\cos(2x)

        $$
        \Large\downarrow
        $$

        \Large 1 + \cos(2x)
        $$

        \Large\downarrow

        $$
        \Large{1 + \cos(2x)\over 2}
        $$
        as substituting “$2x$” for “$x$” effects a horizontal
        compression by $2$.
        (See
        the second case
        of Exercise 27, in particular.)

        (NB: If we do it the other way around,
        putting the vertical scaling before the vertical
        translation, we obtain “${1\over 2}\cos(2x)$”
        as the third function and “${1\over 2} + {1\over 2}\cos(2x)$”
        as the fourth function:

        $$
        \Large\cos(x)
        $$
        $$
        \Large\downarrow
        $$
        $$
        \Large\cos(2x)
        $$
        $$
        \Large\downarrow
        $$
        $$
        \Large{1\over 2}\cos(2x)
        $$
        $$
        \Large\downarrow
        $$
        $$
        \Large{1\over 2} + {1\over 2}\cos(2x)
        $$
        ...which is same-same since
        ${1\over 2} + {1\over 2}\cos(2x) = {1 + \cos(2x)\over 2}$.)

        The issue for the second part of the problem is
        therefore to prove that...

                $$

        ...by algebraic means.

        For this we again use the angle-sum formula

        $$
        \cos(A + B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A)\sin(B)
        $$

        for $\cos$, but with $A = B = x$, namely

        $$
        \begin{align*}
        \cos(2x)
        &= \cos(x + x) \\
        &= \up{1.6} \cos(x)\cos(x) - \sin(x)\sin(x) \\
        &= \up{1.6} \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)
        \end{align*}
        $$

        which gives us

        $$
        \begin{align*}
        {1 + \cos(2x)\over 2}
        &= \up{2.0} {1 + \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x) \over 2} \\
        &= \up{2.0} {(1 - \sin^2(x)) + \cos^2(x)\over 2} \\
        &= \up{2.0} {\cos^2(x) + \cos^2(x)\over 2} \\
        &= \up{2.0} {2\cos^2(x)\over 2} \\

    |> Solution

        Note that $\sin + \cos$
        has period $4\eta$ just like $\sin$ or
        $\cos$, but, unlike $\sin$ and $\cos$,
        $\sin + \cos$ reaches a maximum of $\sqrt{2}$
        at $x = \eta/2$, as uncovered in Exercise 18,
        from which the following graphic is recovered:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cos_to_sin_plus_cos_reminder.svg

        (We have added the minimum at $y = -\sqrt{2}$,
        which is no harder to prove than the
        maximum at $y = \sqrt{2}$.)

        Note that while the above graph may
        __seem__
        like a sinusoid, we have
        __not yet proved__
        that it is a sinusoid, which is indeed the goal
        of the current exercise! But we can conjecture
        that the
        following two steps would take us from $y = \cos(x)$
        to $y = \sin(x) + \cos(x)$, given the structure above:
        __1. horizontal translation to the right by $\eta/2$__
        __2. vertical scaling by $\sqrt{2}$__
        Now you might recall from previous discussions
        (cf. Exercise 7 of Chapter 3, part 1 of Exercise 27
        in this chapter) that
        $$
        x \ra f(x + a)
        $$
        has a graph that is the translate of $y = f(x)$ to
        left by $a$ units, whence
        $$
        x \ra f(x - a)
        $$
        has a graph that is the translate of $y = f(x)$ to
        the _right_ by $a$ units; whence, we can
        conjecture that...

        ...[$\cos(x)$, translated, scaled] actually coincides
        with $\cos(x) + \sin(x)$!!! (!!!)

        For the proof, we resort to the angle-sum formula...
        $$
        \cos(A + B) = \cos A\cos B - \sin A\sin B

        |> SolutionNote

            The fact that
            $$
            \sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{0.5} = 1
            $$
            can also be seen from the fact that
            $$
            \sqrt{0.5} = {1\over \sqrt{2}}
            $$
            that some might prefer.
            !! that is indeed the preferred way of writing $\sqrt{0.5}$
            !! for many people.


|> Exercise

    Prove that for every $A_1$, $A_2 \in \rr$,
    $$
    x \ra A_1\cos x + A_2\sin x
    $$
    equals
    $$
    x \ra W\cdot \cos(x + \psi)
    $$
    for some appropriate constants $W$ and $\psi$. (That shall
    be functions of $A_1$, $A_2$.) Also: draw a deep analogy
    to polar coordinates, regarding the transform that gives
    $W$, $\psi$ as a function of $A_1$, $A_2$.

    |> Solution

        One approach is to expand
        $$
        \cos(x + \psi)
        $$
        using the angle-sum formula, which gives
        $$
        \cos(x)\cos(\psi) - \sin(x)\sin(\psi)
        $$
        after which multiplying by $W$ and collecting coefficients of
        $\cos x$, $\sin x$ gives
        $$
        \up{1.4}(W \cdot \cos \psi)\cdot\cos(x) - (W \cdot \sin \psi) \cdot \sin(x)
        $$
        comparing to
        $$
        A_1\cos x + A_2\sin x
        $$
        we see that
        $W \cos(x + \psi)$
        would equal
        $A_1\cos x + A_2\sin x$
        if we could find $W$, $\psi$ such that
        $$
        \phantom{-}W\cdot\cos(\psi) = A_1
        $$
        $$
        -W\cdot\sin(\psi) = A_2
        $$
        ...that we can actually rewrite
        $$
        W\cdot\cos(-\psi) = A_1
        $$
        $$
        W\cdot\sin(-\psi) = A_2
        $$
        because $\cos(-x) = \cos(x)$, $-\sin(x) = \sin(-x)$
        for all $x \in \rr$. But the above
        two
        equations are very similar to
        $$
        r\cdot\cos(\theta) = x
        $$
        $$
        r\cdot\sin(\theta) = y
        $$
        that give the transformation
        from polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$
        to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$; in fact these are the
        exact same equations, except that we have
        ‘$W$’ in place of ‘$r$’,
        ‘$-\psi$’
        in place of ‘$\theta$’,
        ‘$A_1$’ in place of ‘$x$’, and
        ‘$A_2$’ in place of ‘$y$’;
        so in other words,
        $$
        (W, -\psi)
        $$
        are the
        __polar coordinates__
        of the Cartesian point
        $$
        (A_1, A_2)
        $$
        with $W$ being the “radius”, or distance to the origin,
        and $-\psi$ being the angle from the $x$ axis (or _argument_):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_polar_discovery.svg

        In particular,
        since every pair of Cartesian coordinates
        has a corresponding pair of polar coordinates
        (in fact, many corresponding pairs!),
        we will
        always be able to find $W$, $\psi$ such as to
        match the equations above,
        which concludes the problem.

        |> SolutionNote

            To explicitly give formulas,
            one can set
            $$
            W = \sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2}
            $$
            and
            $$
            -\psi = \begin{cases}
            \arctan(A_2/A_1) & \te{if }\, A_1 \ne 0, \,\te{else} \\
            \up{1.2}\te{arccot}(A_1/A_2) & \te{if }\, A_2 \ne 0, \,\te{else} \\
            \up{1.2}\rm{?}       & \te{if }\, A_1 = 0, A_2 = 0
            \end{cases}
            $$
            where we are copy-pasting the formula that appears
            in the chapter for going from cartesian to polar
            coordinates (no need to remember this formula, though,
            really); though, IN TRUTH, setting
            $$
            W = -\sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2}
            $$
            would work as well,
            if we add
            $2\eta$ to the argument!

        _Example 1._
        The previously-studied
        $$
        \cos x + \sin x
        $$
        (cf. Exercise 4) corresponds to the case
        $$A_1 = A_2 = 1$$ of this exercise, and
        in which case we can set
        $$W = \sqrt{2}$$ and
        $$\psi = -\eta/2$$
        because the pair
        $$
        (W, \,-\psi) \,=\, (\sqrt{2}, \,\,\eta/2)
        $$
        is a polar coordinate of $(A_1, A_2) = (1, 1)$:

        ...was painstakingly uncovered
        in Exercise 33, if you recall.)

|> Exercise

    If we attempt to express
    $$
    A_1\sin x + A_2\cos x
    $$
    in the form
    $$
    W\cdot\sin(x + \psi)
    $$
    then what does the relationship
    between $A_1$, $A_2$, $W$ and $\psi$ become?

    (NB: We have flipped ‘$\cos$’ and
    ‘$\sin$’ in the first expression, compared
    to Exercise 34, and reducing to that exercise is
    likely to produce confusion.
    Solving from scratch is recommended.)

    |> Solution

        Expanding

        $$
        \sin(x + \psi)
        $$

        by the angle-sum formula gives

        $$
        \sin x\cos \psi + \cos x\sin \psi
        $$

        |> ImageRight
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_polar_discovery2_cloud.svg
            offset_x=8em

        whereby multiplying by $W$ and collecting coefficients
        of $\sin x$, $\cos x$ gives
        $$
        (W\cdot\cos \psi)\cdot\sin x + (W\cdot\sin \psi)\cdot\cos x
        $$
        and equating to
        $$
        A_1\cdot\sin x + A_2\cdot\cos x
        $$
        gives the system of equations
        $$
        W\cdot\cos \psi = A_1
        $$
        $$
        W\cdot\sin \psi = A_2
        $$
        which is to say that, for this specific arrangement of
        the variables,
        $$
        (W, \,\psi)
        $$
        are the __exact__ polar coordinates of $(A_1, A_2)$!!!

|> Exercise

    If aliens descended on Earth, captured everyone,
    took you aside and told you that the fate of
    humanity rested on your ability to “illustrate
    powers of secant”, without further instructions,
    what would you do?

    |> Solution

        Presumably the aliens are asking
        for an illustration of the sequence

        $$
        \sec \theta, \,\sec^2(\theta), \,\sec^3(\theta), \,\sec^4(\theta), \dots
        $$

        for some fixed $\theta$, based on a geometric
        interpretation of $\sec$. (Actually...

        $$
        1, \,\sec \theta, \,\sec^2(\theta), \,\sec^3(\theta),  \,\sec^4(\theta), \dots,
        $$

        ...we should start the sequence at $1$, since
        $1 = \sec^0(\theta)$.) Here is a possibility that
        echoes back to the first solution to Exercise 27:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sec_powers_bounce.svg

        Starting with a length of $1$, bottom left,
        successive multiplications by $\sec(\theta)$
        are performed by “dropping a height up” onto
        the opposite side of the angle $\theta$,
        bouncing back and forth between the two sides.

        If we are willing to reproduce the angle
        $\theta$ several times over,
        another possibility is to draw a “snail stack”
        of right triangles sharing a common vertex:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sec_powers_snail.svg

        Or if we move the angle $\theta$ around from
        one end of the previously obtained segment to
        another, another somewhat exotic possibility is
        this one:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sec_powers_inverted_towers.svg

        We can also take a page from the geometric
        interpretation of sec that is mentioned towards
        the end of the chapter, and draw this figure:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sec_powers_circles.svg

        (In which we are effectively using a circular arc
        to each time realign the last obtained segment with
        horizontal.) In any case, with so many nice drawings,
        you are bound to save humanity!

        |> SolutionNote

            One can note that the third diagram makes a cameo
            appearance within the second diagram (modulo scale):

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sec_powers_bounce_cameo.svg


|> Exercise

    What do similar illustrations look like for
    powers of cosine, and for powers of tangent?

    |> Solution

        For cosines we can copy the same figures as
        for secant, but go “in the other direction”:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_cos_bounce.svg
        |> Image

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_circles.svg

        For ‘tan’ it is possible to produce spirals:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_tan_48_big.svg
        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_tan_48_big_other_spiral.svg

        There is also a staircase possibility (nb:
        the spirals will go inward, and the staircase
        collapses to a point, if $\theta < \eta/2$):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_tan_48_wedge.svg

        We can also do as in the second spiral,
        and put the powers of $\tan(\theta)$ on the
        hypotenuses of the triangles...

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_tan_48_other_wedge.svg

        ...since the size ratio of successive triangles
        is $\tan(\theta)$, by the first staircase drawing!
        (In fact, we could have done this trick with
        powers of sec/cos as well, relabeling some other
        side of the triangle to be the power of $\cos$.)

        |> SolutionNote

            Here are some examples of what we suggest at the

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_cos_snail_other_way.svg
            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_cos_towers_other_way.svg

            (To reiterate, this works because the triangles are all similar,
            and the size ratio of one triangle to the previous—specifically,
            the ratio of the hypotenuses—is
            $\cos(\theta)$.)

        |> SolutionNote

            To illustrate powers of
            $$
            \cot(\theta)
            $$
            one can start from the illustrations for
            $$
            \tan(\theta)
            $$
            and replace the complementary angle by ‘$\theta$’.
            E.g.:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_cot_48_big.svg

            Likewise, to illustrate powers of
            $$
            \sin(\theta)
            $$
            one can start with an illustration for powers of
            $\cos(\theta)$ and reverse the role of $\theta$ and
            its complement. E.g., with our two variations of the
            snail:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_sin_snail.svg
            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_costan_powers_sin_snail_other_way.svg

            (Likewise to switch from an illustration of $\sec$
            to illustration of $\csc$ it suffices to move $\theta$
            around, not that aliens will ever descend on Earth and
            ask us these things.)


|> Exercise

    What sequence of geometric transformations
    of the plane will map the graph
    $$
    y = \cos(x)
    $$
    onto the graph...
    $$
    y = \cos(0.1x + 0.1)
    $$
    ...?

    |> Solution

        Place $\cos(x + 0.1)$ as an intermediate function
        between $\cos(x)$ and $\cos(0.1x + 0.1)$,
        breaking the transformation into two steps:

        $$
        \cos(x)
        $$
        $$
        \downarrow
        $$
        $$
        \cos(x + 0.1)
        $$
        $$
        \downarrow
        $$
        $$
        \,\cos(0.1x + 0.1).
        $$

        The first step, going to $\cos(x + 0.1)$, shifts
        the graph of cos left by $0.1$ (cf. Exercise 1,
        Exercise 22); the second step dilates the
        resulting graph by a factor $10$ horizontally,
        because the multiplication by $0.1$ slows
        everything down by a factor $10$. Thus

        $$
        y = \cos(0.1x + 0.1)
        $$

        is obtained from $y = \cos(x)$ by:

        __1. left translation by $0.1$__
        __2. horizontal scaling by $10$__

        (Or “horizontal compression by $0.1$”, for 2.)

        |> SolutionNote

            One can also place $\cos(0.1x)$ as an
            intermediate function between $\cos(x)$ and
            $\cos(0.1x + 0.1)$:
            $$
            \cos(x)
            $$
            $$
            \downarrow
            $$
            $$
            \cos(0.1x)
            $$
            $$
            \downarrow
            $$
            $$
            \,\cos(0.1(x + 1)) = \cos(0.1x + 0.1).
            $$
            In this case the first step, going to $\cos(0.1x)$,
            dilates the graph horizontally by a factor $10$,
            while the second step, in which $x$ is replaced
            by $x + 1$, shifts the resulting graph to the
            left by $1$, and the obtained sequence is:

            __1. horizontal scaling by $10$__
            __2. left translation by $1$__

            (Indeed, this ends up performing the same overall
            transformation of the plane as the first solution,
            albeit decomposed differently in terms of its sub-steps.
            Neither sequence is more correct than the other.)

        |> SolutionNote

            Take the following three-box assemblage, that
            computes $x \ra \cos(0.1x + 0.1)$:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cos_01x.svg

            (The label of the middle box is pasted diagonally
            above the box because of reasons of space.)

            We can understand our first solution as gluing
            the middle and right boxes onto the ‘$\cos$’ box
            one at a time, and observing the effect of each
            additional gluing on the graph:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cos_01x_2.svg

            On the other hand, if we perform the same
            analysis on this alternate three-box sequence...

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cos_01x_3.svg

            ...that also computes $x \ra \cos(0.1x + 0.1)$,
            we recover our second solution:

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_cos_01x_4.svg

|> Exercise

    More generally, how is the graph of
    $$
    x \ra \cos(Bx + C)
    $$
    related to the graph of $\cos$, for constants
    $B$, $C \in \rr$?

    |> Solution

        As in the solution to Exercise 37 place
        $\cos(x + C)$ as an intermediate function between
        $\cos(x)$ and $\cos(Bx + C)$:

        $$
        \cos(x)
        $$
        $$
        \downarrow
        $$
        $$
        \cos(x + C)
        $$
        $$
        \downarrow
        $$
        $$
        \cos(Bx + C)
        $$

        The first step effects a tranlation to the left by $C$,
        the second step (since it replaces $x$ by $Bx$) effects
        a horizontal compression by a factor $B$ (speed-up by
        factor $B$), so the following pair of steps, in order,
        takes the graph $y = \cos(x)$ to the graph $y = \cos(Bx + C)$:

        __1. horizontal translation by $-C$__
        __2. horizontal scaling by $1/B$__

        |> StarDivider

        |> SolutionNote

            Alternately, like Note 1 of Exercise 37, we can
            stop at $\cos(Bx)$ as an intermediate point:

            $$
            \cos(x)
            $$
            $$
            \downarrow
            $$
            $$
            \cos(Bx)
            $$
            $$
            \downarrow
            $$
            $$
            \cos(B(x + C/B)) = \cos(Bx + C)
            $$

            This gives us the following alternate sequence:
            __1. horizontal scaling by $1/B$__
            __2. horizontal translation by $-C/B$__
            ...which is different-but-equivalent, but
            generally considered inferior
            by virtue of involving the more complicated translation
            term, $-C/B$!

        |> SolutionNote

            One says that translation and scaling  are
            __non-commutative__
            because it matters which of the two operations is performed
            first. If it didn't matter,
            then both of our solutions would involve the
            same amount of translation, but they don't!

            (Also:
            __translation and scaling don't commute__
            or
            __transation doesn't commute with scaling__
            ...all good sentences to use in the wild!)


|> Exercise

    If
    $$
    A \ne 0
    $$
    is a point on the $x$ axis, how can we construct
    the value
    $$
    1 / A
    $$
    by purely geometric means?
    (We assume that ‘$0$’ and ‘$1$’ are also marked on the axis.)

    |> Solution

        The key is to view $A$, $1/A$ as values of the form
        $$
        A = \sec(\theta)
        $$
        $$
        1/A = \cos(\theta)
        $$
        for some angle $\theta \in \rr$, if $|A| \geq 1$, or
        as values of the form
        $$
        A = \cos(\theta)
        $$
        $$
        1/A = \sec(\theta)
        $$
        for some angle $\theta \in \rr$, if $|A| \leq 1$.
        In more detail, we make use of the fact that
        $$
        \sec(\theta)
        $$
        can be obtained as the intersection of the tangent
        to the unit circle with the $x$ axis (we never discussed
        this, you can't be faulted for missing it):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_one_over_A_secant_construction.svg

        |> ImageRight
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_one_over_A_secant_construction_cloud.svg

        So the idea is, for example if $|A| \geq 1$, to draw
        a tangent to the circle from $A$, then to drop a height
        onto the $x$ axis:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_one_over_A_secant_Agt1.svg

        ...the position obtained is the corresponding
        $\cos(\theta)$, and $\cos(\theta)\cdot\sec(\theta) = 1$ &#x2705;.
        If $|A| \leq 1$ we can reverse the process,
        “dropping a height onto the circle”, and then finding
        the intersection of the tangent at that point with
        the $x$ axis! (Which will not work, as should be,
        if and only if $\cos(\theta) = 0$, a.k.a., if and only
        if $A = 0$.)


|> Exercise

    In the following drawing at what
    coordinates does the tangent to the circle
    intersect the axes, as marked by the purple
    triangles?

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_60_tangent.svg

    |> Solution

        First we note that the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of
        the point of tangency are  $1/2$ and
        $\sqrt{0.75} = {\sqrt{3}\over 2}$, being $\cos(60^\circ)$
        and $\sin(60^\circ)$ respectively:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_60_tangent_with_coordinates.svg

        But by Exercise 43 this implies that the coordinate
        of the intersectionj of the tangent is

        $$

        with the $y$ axis, reasoning symmetrically.

    |> Solution

        We will compute the two green lengths, then the

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_floorplan_soln1.svg

        Proceeding, the longer and smaller green lengths
        are $112\rt{0.1} \cdot \sin(25.5^\circ\hlfbk)$
        and $8\rt{0.1} \cdot \cos(25.5^\circ\hlfbk)$ inches,
        respectively:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_floorplan_soln2.svg

        The red length is therefore

        \begin{align*}
        &\,\,268 - 8 - 112\cdot\sin(25.5^\circ\hlfbk) - 8\cdot\cos(25.5^\circ\hlfbk) \\

        $$

        (inches) while the blue length is

        $$
        \tan(22^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot[260 - 112\cdot\sin(25.5^\circ\hlfbk) - 8\cdot\cos(25.5^\circ\hlfbk)]
        $$

        (inches) and the final answer is

        $$
        130 + \tan(22^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot[260 - 112\cdot\sin(25.5^\circ\hlfbk) - 8\cdot\cos(25.5^\circ\hlfbk)]

        minus some. (Approximating to $1/100$-th of an inch

                assume the door has negligible thicknesss

    |> Solution

        We start by computing these lengths in the
        original plane of the $2$-dimensional drawing:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_opening_door_soln1.svg

        (Nb: One can also compute the length marked ‘2’ as
        $$
        {42\over \tan(23^\circ)}
        $$
        since $\cot = 1/\tan$, or
        $$
        42\cdot \tan(67^\circ)
        $$
        since $67^\circ = 90^\circ - 23^\circ$ is the complement
        of $23^\circ$.)

        Next, as

        $$
        0.5
        $$

        is the distance from the side of the door to its
        hinge, the door swings at a radius of

        $$
        38.5
        $$

        and the distance between the hinge's center
        and the ceiling, measured horizontally at the top
        of the door, is

        $$
        30.945 - 0.5 = 30.445...
        $$

        by subtracting from the length marked ‘5’.
        We can draw the following overhead sketch of the situation
        (not to scale, and keeping to $3$ digits of accuracy):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_opening_door_overhead.svg

        Here

        $$
        \arctan
        $$

        is a function that you can find notated as

        $$
        \te{“}\tan^{-1}\te{”}
        $$

        on your calculator (a questionable choice of notation,
        because it is _not_ the same as $1/\tan = \cot$), and
        sometimes known as

        __tangent inverse__

        by the gallery, converts a fraction of the form

        $$
        {\te{opposite}\over\te{adjacent}}
        $$

        into the corresponding angle whose tangent equals that
        fraction.

        The final answer to the problem is...

|> Exercise

    (Speaking of doors with negligible thickness.)
    The sketch below shows the top view of a bomb
    shelter door set in a corner near a wall,
    with distances in centimeters.
    How far can the door open when the big handle
    is in the “open” position, shown in the figure?
    How far can it open when the big handle is in
    the “closed” position, shown by the dotted line?

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_bomb_shelter_door_tru_sizes.svg

    |> Solution

        In the interest of mass-producing our results
        we will write a general formula to compute
        $\alpha$ in terms of $x_0$, $y_0$ and $z$ in
        the following diagram (note that $r = \sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2}$):

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_bomb_shelter_door_alpha_x0y0.svg

        We can decompose
        $$
        \alpha
        $$
        as
        $$
        90^\circ + \beta - \gamma
        $$
        with $\beta$ and $\gamma$ as depicted here:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_bomb_shelter_door_alpha_decomposed.svg

        By definition of ‘$\arctan$’ (cf. Exercise 43),
        we have
        $$
        \gamma = \arctan(y_0/x_0)
        $$
        and

        $$
        \beta = \arctan(z/\sqrt{r^2 - z^2})
        $$

        or

        $$
        \beta = \arctan(z/\sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - z^2})
        $$

        directly in terms of $z$, $x_0$ and $y_0$, since
        $r^2 = x_0^2 + y_0^2$, so

        $$
        \alpha = 90^\circ + \arctan(z/\sqrt{x_0^2 + y_0^2 - z^2}) - \arctan(y_0/x_0)
        $$

        |> ImageRight
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_bomb_shelter_door_alpha_cloud.svg

        which constitutes our “general formula”.

        From this point, we apply the general formula with
        $z = 66 - 18 = 44$,
        $(x_0, y_0) = (60, 30)$,
        $(x_0, y_0) = (93, 30)$, and
        $(x_0, y_0) = (108, 22)$:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_bomb_shelter_annotated.svg

        The three values of $\alpha$ obtained, respectively,
        are...

        $$
        \alpha = 90^\circ + \arctan(48/\sqrt{60^2 + 30^2 - 48^2}) - \arctan(30/60) = 109.1225\ldots^\circ
        $$

        $$
        \alpha = 90^\circ + \arctan(48/\sqrt{93^2 + 30^2 - 48^2}) - \arctan(30/93) = 101.5410\ldots^\circ
        $$

        $$
        \alpha = 90^\circ + \arctan(48/\sqrt{108^2 + 22^2 - 48^2}) - \arctan(22/108) = 104.3033\ldots^\circ
        $$

        ...being, namely, upper bounds on the amount of
        rotation of the door caused by a putative contact of
        the big handle in open position with the wall, of the
        big handle in closed position with the wall, and of
        the small handle with the wall.

        (By the way: don't be confused by the fact that
        $\alpha$ is not an angle measured “from
        horizontal”; $\alpha$ is still the amount of rotation (aperture)
        undergone by the door, as it measures the amount of rotation
        of a specific point attached to the door!)

        In particular, since

        $$
        104.3033\ldots < 109.1225\ldots
        $$

        the big handle is not the limiting factor when
        the big handle is in open position, at which point
        the small handle is the limiting factor and prevents
        the door from opening more than $104^\circ$-and-some,
        whereas since

        $$
        101.5410\ldots < 104.3033\ldots
        $$

        the big handle becomes the limiting factor when it
        is in closed position, at which point the door can
        only open to $101^\circ$-and-some!

        ...sketch, and because the
        overall scaling in area is the latitudinal
        scaling factor times the longitudinal
        scaling factor. (Area = width $\times$ height,
        so you take the factor by which “width” scales,
        times the factor by which “height” scales—presuming
        your old “width” and “height” are still at right
        angle to one another after the projection, which
        is the case here: longitudes and latitudes, that
        are perpendicular on the sphere, project to
        lines and circles, respectively, that are
        perpendicular on the cylinder.)


|> Exercise

    Rank the $7$ slices of this
    sphere with unit radius from the greatest to
    smallest area slice:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ex_pez_sphere_statement.svg

    |> Solution

        The three slices of height $1/3$ have the same
        area, as do the four slices of height $1/4$. But
        naturally, the slices of height $1/3$ have larger
        area than the slices of height $1/4$.

        |> SolutionNote

            This holds because each slice has the same area
            as the horizontal projection of that slice onto a cylinder
            hugging the sphere, by Exercise 46, and because
            the area of a cylinder slice only depends on its
            height.

            |> ImageRight
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_pez_sphere_cloud.svg

        |> SolutionNote

            The slices of height $1/3$ have area exactly
            $$
            {1/3 \over 1/4} = 4/3 = 1.333...
            $$
            times the area of the slices of height $1/4$,
            given that the area of a slice is directly
            proportional to its height.


|> Exercise

    Give a formula for the area of a sphere of
    radius $r$.

    |> Solution

        The area of a sphere of radius $r$ is
        $$
        4\eta\rt{0.05}r\cdot 2r = 8\eta\rt{0.05}r^2
        $$
        because it is the same as the area of a cylinder
        of radius $r$ and and height $2r$, by Exercise 46:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sphere_area.svg

        (Namely,
        $$
        4\eta\rt{0.05}r\cdot 2r
        $$
        is the product “circumference $\times$ height”
        that gives the area of the cylinder.)


|> Exercise

    Give a formula for the volume of a sphere of
    radius $r$ using the fact that the volume of
    a cone is “one third base times height”.

    |> Solution

        The basic idea is that we can view the
        sphere as being made up of many cones:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sphere_volume_idea.svg

        When we add up the volume

        $$
        {1\over 3}\times \rm{base} \times \rm{height}
        $$

        over all these cones, each height is nearly $r$,
        so what we really need is the sum of

        $$
        {1\over 3}\times \rm{base}
        $$

        over all the cones, which comes out to

        $$
        {1\over 3}\times ({\rm sphere\,\,area})
        $$

        because the sum of all the areas of the bases
        is the sphere area. (Everything speaking
        approximately, for many fine cones, in the
        limit of our imagination as they become
        infinitely fine.) (*Where each ‘base’ stands
        for the shaved-off, “flattened” version of the
        base.) So multiplying the height $r$ back in,
        we find

        |> center
            style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;
            |> div
                style=display:inline-block;border:1px solid red;padding:1em 1em;

                $$
                V = {1\over 3}\times ({\rm sphere\,\,area}) \times r = {8\over 3}\eta\rt{.1}r^3
                $$

        for the volume $V$ of the sphere, using the fact that
        the sphere area $A$ is

        |> center
            style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;
            |> div
                style=display:inline-block;border:1px solid red;padding:1em 1em;

                $$
                A = 8\eta\rt{.05}r^2
                $$

        by Exercise 49.

        |> SolutionNote

            To formalize the argument, consider that
            we can approximate the volume of the sphere
            by finitely many cones with triangular bases,
            by triangulating the surface of the sphere:

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sphere_tetrahedrons.svg

            Note that a cone with a triangular base is
            just a

            __tetrahedron__

            |> ImageLeft
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sphere_volume_cones_cloud.svg

            where “tetrahedron” means “four-sided shape”.
            (There is only 1 way to pull off a four-sided
            shape in 3D: to make all sides triangles.)
            So the volume of the sphere is approximated
            by the sum of the volumes of the tetrahedrons,
            a.k.a. cones.

            Define the

            __mesh size__

            of such a set of tetrahedrons to be the largest
            sidelength of any tetrahedron base.

            (The smaller the mesh size, the more pointed
            the tetrahedrons.)

            For the current
            discussion we take it for granted that as the
            mesh size shrinks, the sum of the volumes of
            the cones (= tetrahedrons) converges to the
            volume of sphere.

            (Or take the limit, as the mesh size shrinks,
            of the sum of the volume of the tetrahedrons
            to be the _definition_ of the “volume of the
            sphere”—that's just as well, since we don't have
            any other competing notion of “volume of the sphere”,
            at the moment.)

            Here is a closer look at a single tetrahedron
            ($h_i$ is the height of the tetrahedron):

            |> Image
                src=images/svg_ch5_ex_sphere_volume_closeup.svg

            One observes that
            $$
            B_i \leq A_i
            $$
            where
            $$
            B_i
            $$
            is the base of the tetrahedron and
            $$
            A_i
            $$
            is the projection of the base onto the surface
            of the sphere from the center of the sphere, and
            that
            $$
            h_i \leq r
            $$
            where
            $
            h_i
            $
            is the height of the tetrahedron, and $r$ is the
            radius of sphere. On the other hand, it is not hard
            to convince oneself that
            $$
            B_i \geq 0.9A_i
            $$
            and
            $$
            h_i \geq 0.9r
            $$
            for all of the tetrahedrons, if the mesh size is
            sufficiently small; even,
            $$
            B_i \geq 0.99A_i
            $$
            and
            $$
            h_i \geq 0.99r
            $$
            for all of the tetrahedrons simultaenously,
            _if the mesh size is sufficiently small_; even,
            $$
            B_i \geq 0.99999A_i
            $$
            and
            $$
            h_i \geq 0.99999r
            $$
            for all... if etc.

            (Or as mathematicians would put it: “for all $\e > 0$
            there exists an $s > 0$ such that
            $$
            B_i \geq (1-\e)A_i
            $$
            and
            $$
            h_i \geq (1-\e)r
            $$
            for all of the tetrahedrons, if the mesh size less than $s$.”)
            (“For all... there exists... such that... if... .”)

            This implies that
            $$
            \sum_{i=1}^N {1\over 3}B_ih_i
            $$
            [nb: fast-foward to Exercise 38 if you have never
            seen $\sum$-notation, but this basically reads
            “sum from $i$ equals $1$ up to $N$”] which is the
            total volume of the tetrahedrons, where $N$ denotes
            the number of tetrahedrons and $B_i$, $h_i$ are the
            base and height of the $i$-th tetrahedron, is
            sandwiched between

            $$
            \sum_{i=1}^N {1\over 3}A_i r
            $$

            below, for sufficiently small mesh size; but

            $$
            \sum_{i=1}^N A_i = A
            $$

            where $A = 8\eta\rt{.05}r^2$ is the total area
            of the sphere, and so

            $$
            \sum_{i=1}^N {1\over 3}B_ih_i
            $$

            is sandwiched between

            $$
            \sum_{i=1}^N {1\over 3}A_ir = {1\over 3}\cdot r\cdot \sum_{i=1}^N A_i = {1\over 3}Ar

            \sum_{i=1}^N {1\over 3}\cdot 0.99999\cdot A_i\cdot 0.99999\cdot r = (0.99999)^2{1\over 3}Ar
            $$

            below; or, nicely put in a double inequality:

            |> center
                style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;
                |> div

                    $$
                    {1\over 3}Ar \geq \sum_{i=1}^N {1\over 3}B_ih_i \geq (0.99999)^2{1\over 3}Ar
                    $$

            ...but we could replace “$0.99999$” by any other
            constant less that $1$ [yah no: because of the square,
            we need to say “between $0$ and $1$”] by further
            shrinking the size of the mesh, which implies that

            $$
            \sum_{i=1}^N {1\over 3}B_ih_i
            $$

            must converge to

            $$
            {1\over 3}Ar
            $$

            as the mesh size goes to zero—it cannot converge to
            something greater than, nor less than, this number!

            !! not to forget.)


|> Exercise

    Similarly to Exercise 9, suggest a definition for
    the product

    $$
    c\cdot\vec{v}
    $$

    of a vector $\vec{v}$ by a real number $c$.

    |> Solution

        We define

        $$
        c \cdot (v_x, v_y) = (c\rt{0.1}v_x, c\rt{0.1}v_y)
        $$

        for the product of a real number $c$ with a
        vector $\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y) \in \rr^2$.
        (Similarly for a vector of higher dimension—those
        exist too.)

        In other words, the product takes the constant
        $c$ “inside”, multiplying each coordinate of
        the vector by $c$.

        |> Pause

        _Example 1._ We have
        $$
        2 \cdot (10, 3.333) = (20, 6.666),
        $$
        applying the definition with $c = 2$,
        $\vec{v} = (10, 3.333)$.

        |> Pause

        _Example 2._ We have
        $$
        2 \cdot (a, b) = (2a, 2b),
        $$
        for all $a, b \in \rr$, for an example
        that is half-algebraic, half-numerical.

        |> SolutionNote

            In some sense, the vector “wins” over the
            number, in that their conjoint baby is a vector,
            not a number.
