    *Cos and Sin. (“Cosine” and “sine”.)*
    We've already encountered the ‘cos’
    function in Exercise 7 of Chapter 3, e.g..
    It is the one that has this graph:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_cosine.svg

    It has a close cousin named ‘sin’.
    While $\cos(x)$ “tops off” at $x = 0$,
    $\sin(x)$ goes diagonally through the point
    $(0, 0)$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_cosine_and_sine.svg

    As far as standard definitions go,
    $\cos(x)$ is the

    __$x$-coordinate__

    and $\sin(x)$ is the

    __$y$-coordinate__

    of a point $x$ units counterclockwise from
    $(1, 0)$ on the unit circle. (Nb: “a”

    __unit circle__

    is a circle of radius $1$, while “the” unit
    circle is the circle of radius $1$ centered
    at $(0, 0)$.) For example, if we look at $x = {1\over 2}$,
    we see $\cos({1\over 2}) \approx 0.9$,
    $\sin({1\over 2}) \approx 0.5$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_cosine_and_sine_@0.5.svg

    !! The reason for these values, per the definitions,
    !! is that
    Per the definitions,
    the point half a unit
    counterclockwise from $(1, 0)$ on the unit
    circle has coordinates $\approx 0.9$ in $x$
    and $\approx 0.5$ in $y$ (or actually $0.87758...$
    and $0.47942...$, it turns out, as we can know by
    a calculator equipped with ‘sin’ and ‘cos’):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_unit_circle_@0.5_smaller.svg

    As a second example, the graphs indicate that
    $\sin(-3) \approx -0.2$, $\cos(-3) \approx -0.99$
    (or something very close to $-1$, in any case):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_cosine_and_sine_@-3.svg

    Indeed, going $-3$ units counterclockwise—which
    means, going $3$ units clockwise—on the unit
    circle, starting from $(1, 0)$, brings us to a point
    with $y$- and $x$-coordinates of $\approx -0.2$
    and $\approx -0.99$ respectively (or $-0.1411...$
    and $-0.989992...$, to be exact, it turns out):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_unit_circle_@-3_smaller.svg

    For a last example,
    note that there appears
    to be a value of $x$ near $-1.6$, where $\cos(x) = 0$,
    $\sin(x) = -1$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_cosine_and_sine_@minus_eta.svg

    Some thought reveals that this value of $x$
    would be _minus one-quarter the circumference
    of a unit circle_, because $(0, -1)$ is
    one-quarter of the unit circle clockwise from $(1, 0)$.
    Note that one-quarter the circumference of a unit
    circle was estimated to be

    $$
    \approx {11\over 7} = 1.\overline{571428}
    $$

    in Exercise 24 of Chapter 3 (by direct inspection
    of the graph $y = \cos(x)$, for that matter,
    which may or may not be cheating), which agrees
    with the visual estimate $x \approx -1.6$. (But
    that value would be namely $x = -1.57...$, not
    $x = -1.6$.)

    !! (Etc.)

    In another possible definition,

    $$
    \sin(x)
    $$

    is defined as the $x$-coordinate of a point that
    is $x$ units counterclockwise from $(0, -1)$ on
    the unit circle. In this case, $\sin(x)$ and
    $\cos(x)$ are both defined by $x$-coordinates:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_unit_circle_with_new_definition.svg

    In more detail, if you tilt your head  sideways,
    you will see that the $x$ axis looks, from the
    vantage point of $(0, -1)$, the same as the $y$
    axis looks from the vantage point of $(1, 0)$.
    So the old and new definitions of $\sin(x)$ are
    equivalent! (👍👍)

    In particular, $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ can also
    be understood as the $x$-coordinates of two
    particles on the unit circle such that the ‘sin’
    particle is one-quarter-turn behind the ‘$\cos$’
    particle:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_unit_circle_with_sin_and_cos_particles.svg

    ...to be contrasted with our first definition,
    employing a single point projected onto
    two different axes:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_unit_circle_with_sincos_particle.svg

    The second definition (former diagram) explains
    why values of $\sin$ lag a fixed amount behind
    values of $\cos$. (“Lagging” when you read the
    graphs from left to right.) It's because the ‘sin’
    particle follows in the trail blazed by the ‘cos’
    particle!

|> Section

    *Derivatives.*
    Continuing the last “chapter” in the
    definitions of $\sin$ and $\cos$, we can
    add two more particles to the diagram that
    defines ‘sin’ and ‘cos’ via $x$-coordinates.
    The two new particles are labeled “$-\!\sin$”
    and “$-\!\cos$”:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_unit_circle_with_four_particles.svg

    These labels are chosen
    because
    the $x$-coordinate of the
    “$-\!\sin$”
    particle is
    $$
    -\!\sin(x)
    $$
    by symmetry with the $\sin$ particle,
    meaning that the
    “$-\!\sin$”
    particle
    defines the function
    $$
    x \ra -\!\sin(x)
    $$
    also known simply as

    _|“$-\!\sin$”|_

    by the general definition that
    $$
    -f = (x \ra -f(x))
    $$
    for all $f : \rr \ra \rr$,
    and similarly for “$-\!\cos$”.

    Adding the curves for $-\!\sin$ and $-\!\cos$
    to the graphs fills the “gap” between $y = \sin(x)$
    and $y = \cos(x)$ with two new equally-spaced curves;
    note that
    $\cos$ lags behind $-\!\sin$
    (reading the graphs from left to right)
    by the same amount that $\sin$ lags behind
    $\cos$, etc:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_four_curves.svg

    These are the same four curves that
    appear in Exercise 12 of Chapter 4.
    In particular,
    $$
    \sin' = \cos
    $$
    $$
    \cos' = -\!\sin
    $$
    $$
    (-\!\sin)' = -\!\cos
    $$
    $$
    (-\!\cos)' = \sin
    $$
    because the rate of change of each
    particle's $x$-coordinate is the
    $x$-coordinate of the next particle
    in the order of rotation, as explained
    in the solution to that problem.
    (Clockwise vs. counterclockwise rotation
    notwithstanding.)

    One can also note that
    $$
    (-f)' = ((-1)\cdot f)' = (-1) \cdot f' = -f'
    $$
    in general for any $f : \rr \ra \rr$
    (cf. Exercise 20 and Exercise 10 of Chapter 4),
    which implies that
    $$
    (-\!\sin)' = -\!\sin'
    $$
    (or
    $$
    (-\!\sin)' = -\!\sin' = -\!\cos
    $$
    to finish the computation),
    and that
    $$
    (-\!\cos)' = -\!\cos'
    $$
    (or
    $$
    (-\!\cos)' = -\!\cos' = -(-\!\sin) = \sin
    $$
    to finish the computation),
    which means that one only needs to
    remember the first two equations. Though,
    in fact, one really just needs to remember
    the four-particle diagram!
    !! (Or really,
    !! just remember the four-particle diagram.)

    *Even/odd identities, and identities with “$\eta$”.*
    One has

    $$
    \displaylines{
    \up{1.0}\cos(-x) = \cos(x) \\
    \up{1.7}\sin(-x) = -\sin(x) \\
    \up{1.7}\sin(x + \eta) = \cos(x) \\
    \up{1.7}\cos(x - \eta) = \sin(x) \\
    \up{1.7}\dn{0.5}\cos(\eta/2 + x) = \sin(\eta/2 - x)
    }
    $$

    for all $x \in \rr$, where

    $$
    \Large \eta
    $$

    (“aye-tah”, Greek letter “eta”) is a
    constant that denotes the quarter-circumference
    of a unit circle, or about ${11\over 7}$.
    (Cf. Exercise 24, Chapter 4.) You should
    be able to verify each of these identities
    just by looking at them and thinking of the
    definitions of $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$—possibly
    the “second” definition of $\sin(x)$, in some
    cases—but in case something goes wrong, here
    is a cheat sheet that does some of the thinking
    for you (or, help you compare your way of seeing
    things to the author's way of seeing things):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_identity_explanations.svg

    Two more identities
    $$
    \sin(\eta - x) = \cos(x)
    $$
    and
    $$
    \cos(\eta - x) = \sin(x)
    $$
    are related to the last identity above, in that they
    involve symmetry about the line $x = y$ in the Cartesian
    plane:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_identity_explanations_more.svg

    We also have these identities...

    $$
    \displaylines{
    \up{1.2}\cos(x + 4\eta) = \cos(x)\\
    \up{1.7}\sin(x + 4\eta) = \rt{0.15}\sin(x)\rt{0.15}\\
    \up{1.7}\cos(x + 2\eta) = \rt{0.15}-\!\cos(x)\rt{0.15}\\
    \up{1.7}\sin(x + 2\eta) = \rt{0.15}-\!\sin(x)\rt{0.15}
    }
    $$

    ...that follow because one full turn
    around the circle brings you back to the
    same position, whereas a half-turn brings
    you around  to your _antipode_ (where
    both coordinates are negated), and these
    two more...

    $$
    \displaylines{\up{1.0}\cos(x + \eta) = -\!\sin(x) \\
    \up{1.7}\sin(x - \eta) = -\!\cos(x)}
    $$

    ...that follow from the four-particle
    diagram, e.g..

|> Section

    *Relation to derivatives.*
    Note that the derivatives of
    sin and cos can also be expressed by
    the [possibly more “logical”] formulas

    $$
    \sin'(x) = \sin(x + \eta)
    $$
    $$
    \cos'(x) = \cos(x + \eta)
    $$

    given that

    $$
    \sin(x + \eta) = \cos(x)
    $$
    $$
    \cos(x + \eta) = -\!\sin(x)
    $$

    as seen in the previous section.

    In fact, one can make the further observation that

    $$
    \sin^{(\ell)}(x) = \sin(x + \ell\eta)
    $$
    $$
    \cos^{(\ell)}(x) = \cos(x + \ell\eta)
    $$

    where “$^{(\ell)}$” denotes the $\ell$-th
    derivative, for all $\ell \in \nn$.
    !! Each
    !! derivative is obtained by moving to the next
    !! particle in the order of rotation, i.e.,
    !! by adding $+\eta$ to the input!
    Since each
    derivative is obtained by moving to the next
    particle in the order of rotation, each
    derivative is obtained by adding $+\eta$ to the
    input!

    *The pythagorean identity.*
    Because

    $$
    x^2 + y^2 = 1
    $$

    is the equation of the unit circle, and
    points of the form

    $$
    (\cos(x), \sin(x))
    $$

    are points on the unit circle, we have

    $$
    \cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1 \tag{*}
    $$

    for all $x \in \rr$, surprise or not.
    We refer to (*) as the _pythagorean identity_.

    Various “tricks” are associated to the
    pythagorean identity. For example, the
    number

    $$
    1
    $$

    is forevermore suspect, because it might
    just be

    $$
    \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x)
    $$

    (or for some other variable) in disguise,
    depending on the situation. Also

    $$
    \sin^2(y)
    $$

    (variable not important) might be

    $$
    1 - \cos^2(y)
    $$

    just as

    $$
    \cos^2(y)
    $$

    might be

    $$
    1 - \sin^2(y)
    $$

    (also

    $$
    1 - \cos^2(y)
    $$

    and

    $$
    1 - \sin^2(y)
    $$

    might end up respectively rewritten

    $$
    (1 - \cos(y))\cdot (1 + \cos(y))
    $$

    and

    $$
    (1 - \sin(y))\cdot (1 + \sin(y))
    $$

    by the difference-of-squares factorization),
    and

    $$
    \sin^2(\theta) - \cos^2(\theta)
    $$

    might be

    $$
    1 - 2\cos^2(\theta)
    $$

    or otherwise

    $$
    2\sin^2(\theta) - 1
    $$

    and symmetrically for the opposite difference. (I.e.,

    $$
    \,\cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta),
    $$

    this one.) Etc.

    *Inputs as radians.*
    The

    __radian measure__

    of an angle was briefly touched upon in
    Note >>DifferentiationFormulasClarification of Exercise 37, Chapter 4.
    In short, it is a “scientific” measure
    of angles in which the value of an angle
    is the length of a circular arc subtended
    by the angle, divided by the radius of
    that arc:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_radian_definition.svg

    The definition implies that the radian
    measure of an angle is the length subtended
    by the angle on a unit circle:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_radian_definition_radius_1.svg

    In particular, $90^\circ$ is $\eta$ radians:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_radian_definition_90_degrees_is.svg

    To imprint this fact in our memories:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_radian_definition_90_imprint.svg

    (We will often leave out the “rad”—in fact,
    if you don't see a degree symbol “$^\circ$”
    next to an angle measure, that means the angle
    measure is a radian.) From there, other radian
    measures can be proportionally deduced; for
    example, $45^\circ$ is $\eta/2$ radians:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_radian_definition_45_imprint.svg

    aaaand... and so on.

    As a consequence of the definition, a
    displacement of $x$ units on the unit circle
    subtends an angle—or technically: _rotation_,
    because there is a “positive” direction—and
    you can also say _signed angle_ instead of
    _rotation_, by the way—whose (signed) radian
    measure is $x$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_x_displacement_and_x_radians.svg

    In particular,
    instead of positing the definitions of
    sin and cos like this...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_x_displacement_and_x_radians_displacement_definition.svg

    ...with the input appearing as a
    displacement, we can posit the definitions
    like this...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch_ch_x_displacement_and_x_radians_radian_definition.svg

    ...with the input appearing as a radian.

    |> Example

        We can conceptualize $\cos(\eta/2)$...

        |> Image
            src=images/svg_ch_5_ch_etaOver2_example_displacement_version.svg

|> Section

    *Auto-converting degrees to radians.*
    We will consider the degree notation
    “$^\circ$” to be pig lipstick on top of
    radians by defining

    $$
    x^\circ = x \cdot {\eta\over 90}
    $$

    for all $x \in \rr$, where the multiplication
    by

    $$
    \eta\over 90
    $$

    converts from degrees to radians.

    For example,

    $$
    90^\circ = 90 \cdot {\eta\over 90} = \eta
    $$

    and

    $$
    45^\circ = 45 \cdot {\eta\over 90} = \eta/2,
    $$

    per this definition.

    In this way, in particular, we can write

    $$
    \cos(90^\circ\hlfbk)
    $$

    as a stand-in for

    $$
    \cos(\eta)
    $$

    ...without committing any informality.

    (Note that

    $$
    \cos(\eta) = 0
    $$

    in case you had any doubt, by the way—an
    angle of $\eta$ puts you at the tippy-top
    of the circle!)

|> Section

    *Sines and cosines of $\mathbf{30^\circ}$,
    $\mathbf{45^\circ}$ and $\mathbf{60^\circ}$.*
    Note that every point of the form

    $$
    (\pm\sqrt{x}, \pm\sqrt{1 - x}),\,\,\,0 \leq x \leq 1 \tag{*}
    $$

    is on the unit circle, because the
    sum-of-the-squares-of-the-two-coordinates is $1$.
    (The equation of the unit circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.)
    E.g.,

    $$
    (\sqrt{0.2}, \sqrt{0.8})
    $$

    is on the unit circle, as is

    $$
    (\sqrt{0.1}, \sqrt{0.9})
    $$

    and so on. (If you're curious, points of this
    family...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_that_family.svg

    ...look like this.) Vice-versa, every point
    on the unit circle has the form (*) for some
    $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and some choice of the ‘$\pm$’
    signs.

    In particular, the unit circle contains the
    following points:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_main_angles_first.svg

    Here

    $$
    (\sqrt{0.5},\, \sqrt{0.5}\rt{0.2})
    $$

    is obviously at $45^\circ\hlfbk$ from the $x$
    axis, which implies

    $$
    \cos(45^\circ\hlfbk) = \sqrt{0.5}
    $$
    $$
    \sin(45^\circ\hlfbk) = \sqrt{0.5}
    $$

    or

    $$
    \cos(\eta/2) = \sqrt{0.5}
    $$
    $$
    \sin(\eta/2) = \sqrt{0.5}
    $$

    in radians. Symmetrically,

    $$
    \cos(135^\circ\hlfbk) = -\sqrt{0.5}
    $$
    $$
    \sin(135^\circ\hlfbk) = \sqrt{0.5}
    $$

    (or

    $$
    \cos(1.5\eta) = -\sqrt{0.5}
    $$
    $$
    \sin(1.5\eta) = \sqrt{0.5}
    $$

    in radians) in the second quadrant, and so on.

    For the remaining values we rely on the
    existence of the following two equilateral
    triangles:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_main_angles_two_equilateral_triangles.svg

    !! These triangles imply that the the unique
    !! point on the unit circle with $x$-coordinate
    !! $0.5$ in the first quadrant is at $60^\circ\hlfbk$
    !! from the $x$ axis, and that the unique point
    !! on the unit circle with $y$-coordinate $0.5$
    !! in the first quadrant is at $30^\circ\hlfbk$
    !! from the $x$ axis; but since
    The first triangle implies that the the unique
    point on the unit circle with $x$-coordinate
    $0.5$ in the first quadrant is at $60^\circ\hlfbk$
    from the $x$ axis, while the second triangle implies that the unique point
    on the unit circle with $y$-coordinate $0.5$
    in the first quadrant is at $30^\circ\hlfbk$
    from the $x$ axis; but since

    $$
    \sqrt{0.25} = 0.5
    $$

    (surprise!), the two points in question must be
    the afore-shown

    $$
    (\sqrt{0.25}, \,\sqrt{0.75}) = (0.5, \,\sqrt{0.75})
    $$

    at the upper tip of the first triangle, and

    $$
    (\sqrt{0.75}, \,\sqrt{0.25}) = (\sqrt{0.75}, \,0.5)
    $$

    at the rightward tip of the second triangle,
    and we find

    $$
    \cos(60^\circ\hlfbk) = 0.5 \,\,(= \sqrt{0.25}),
    $$
    $$
    \sin(60^\circ\hlfbk) = \sqrt{0.75}

    and

    $$
    \cos(30^\circ\hlfbk) = \sqrt{0.75},
    $$
    $$
    \sin(30^\circ\hlfbk) = 0.5 \,\,(= \sqrt{0.25}),
    $$

    *Scaling the circle.*
    In the following diagram, the coordinates
    of the point $P$ are obviously $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$,
    because that is the definition of sin and cos:

    radius $r$, while maintaining the angle $\theta$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_scaling_circle_r.svg

    ...what are the coordinates of $Q$?
    The coordinates are obviously the old coordinates
    scaled up/down by $r$, i.e.,
    $$
    Q = (r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta))
    $$
    or, in individual formulas,
    $$
    Q_x = r\cdot\cos(\theta)
    $$

    Q_y = r\cdot\sin(\theta)

    *Polar coordinates.*
    The so-called

    __polar coordinates__

    of a point $P$ in the plane are a pair of
    numbers

    $$
    (r, \theta)
    $$

    with $r \geq 0$ such that

    $$
    P = (r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta))
    $$

    or namely with the property that:

                $\theta$ is “the” counterclockwise angle
                from the positive $x$ axis to the segment
                $OP$, where $O$ is the origin;

    ...even though $\theta$ is not unique,
    because any multiple of $4\eta$ may be
    added to $\theta$ without altering the
    values of $\sin(\theta)$ or $\cos(\theta)$;
    slightly worse even: if $r = 0$, then
    $\theta$ may be anything. (Because in that
    case

    $$
    P = (0, 0)
    $$

    and any value of $\theta$ will satisfy
    the equation

    $$
    P = (0\cdot \cos(\theta), 0\cdot \sin(\theta))
    $$

    namely.)

    NONETHELESS—even though the polar coordinates
    of a point are not (not ever!) uniquely
    determined, we say “the” polar coordinates of
    a point, out of expediency!

    *Change-of-coordinate formulas.*
    Definitionally, the equations

    $$
    \displaylines{x = r \cos(\theta)\\
    \up{1.3}y = r \sin(\theta)}
    $$

    give the change-of-coordinate formulas
    from a polar coordinate $(r, \theta)$
    to a cartesian coordinate $(x, y)$.
    (It's right there in the promise of what
    it means to be a valid polar coordinate
    $(r, \theta)$.)

    Conversely, to recover the polar
    coordinates $(r, \theta)$ from the cartesian
    coordinates $(x, y)$, one has at least

    $$
    r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
    $$

    by the Pythagorean theorem, but the
    formula for $\theta$ is not so cheerful—out
    of completeness, we can jot it down
    anyway, for your entertainment:

    $$
    \theta = \begin{cases}
    \arctan(y/x)&amp;\te{if }\, x \ne 0, \,\te{else} \\
    \up{1.2}\te{arccot}(x/y) &amp;\te{if }\, y \ne 0, \,\te{else} \\
    \up{1.2}\rm{?} &amp;\te{if }\, x = 0, y = 0
    \end{cases}
    $$

    ...where “arctan”, “arccot” are
    some-functions-or-other-to-be-discussed-later.

    *Right triangles.*
    Hopefully, the following figure should seem
    believable-and/or-familiar, at this point
    (it's a scaled-up/down unit circle):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_triangle_sequence_1.svg

    If we assume $0 \leq \theta \leq \eta$ then both
    $r\cos(\theta)$ and $r\sin(\theta)$ are nonnegative,
    and we can redraw the figure as a relationship between
    the sidelengths of a right triangle:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_triangle_sequence_2.svg

    If we rebrand the three legs of the triangle
    as “hypotenuse”, “opposite”, and “adjacent” according
    to their relationship to the angle $\theta$...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_triangle_sequence_rebranded.svg

    ...the relationship can be written:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_relationships_of_note.svg

    To be paired with this figure:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_relationships_of_note_triangle_version.svg

    The arrows are meant to indicate that $\cos(\theta)$ is the

    __multiplicative factor__

    that takes one from “hypotenuse” to “adjacent”,
    while $\sin(\theta)$ is (again) the

    __multiplicative factor__

    that takes one from “hypotenuse” to “opposite”.

        10\cdot \cos(43^\circ\hlfbk)\cdot \cos(20^\circ\hlfbk)
        $$

        by following two ‘cos’ arrows (i.e.,
        two hypotenuse-to-adjacent arrows) starting
        from the sidelength of $10$.

    *A famous diagram.*
    There is a somewhat infamous diagram similar
    to the diagrams of examples 5 and 6; to draw the
    diagram, start with a “snail shell” stack of
    two right triangles:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_snail_stack_1.svg

    Rotate a copy of the smaller
    triangle by $90^\circ$ towards the bigger one;
    we end up with two pairs of parallel sides:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_snail_stack_2.svg

    Therefore, if we snap a scaled copy of the
    smaller triangle onto the remaining non-hypotenuse
    side of the bigger triangle, we end up with a
    flush side consisting of a single straight
    segment (you can also think in terms of
    angles that add up to $180^\circ$):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_snail_stack_3.svg

    We finish off the diagram by setting the
    hypotenuse of the original big triangle to
    have length $1$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_snail_stack_4.svg

    This completes the diagram. Note that it is
    possible for the sum of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$
    to be greater than $\eta$...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_snail_stack_greater_eta.svg

    ...but, by construction, $\theta_1$ and
    $\theta_2$ are individually in the range from
    $0$ to $\eta$. (Being “proper angles” of right
    triangles.) (You can now contemplate what the
    “utility” of the diagram might be!)

    *The Abercrombie inequality.*
    Take an ordinary angle of aperture less than
    $180^\circ\hlfbk$ with a circular arc drawn
    inside and a line segment spanning the two
    sides of the angle that clears the arc:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_abercrombie_statement.svg

    The eponymous

    __Abercrombie inequality__

    states that
    !! the length of the segment is at
    !! least as much as the length of the arc, i.e.,
    !! that

    $$
    A\leq S
    $$

    in the language of the above figure, i.e.,
    that the length of the segment is
    at least
    !! greater-than-or-equal-to
    the length of the arc.
    !! if $A$ is the length of the arc and $S$ is
    !! the length of the segment, regardless of the
    !! exact configuration of the angle, arc, and
    !! segment. (The segment just has to remain outside
    !! the arc.)

    !! Otherwise—if this were not the case—the
    The proof is that, if this were not the case,
    the
    length
    $S$ of the segment would lie to left of the
    length $A$ of the arc on the number line, as
    pictured in this stylized view of the number line:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_abercrombie_to_the_left.svg

    In the space between $S$ and $A$, we could then
    find the length $P$ of a polygonal line
    approximating the arc...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_abercrombie_with_P.svg

    ...because such polygonal lines can
    approximate the arc arbitrarily closely, i.e.,
    have lengths that come arbitrarily close to
    “$A$” on the number line from the left.
    (This constitutes our “axiomatic” belief
    about the  nature of curved length.) But this
    will be a contradiction, because we claim
    that each segment of the polygonal line has
    length less than its corresponding “shadow”
    on the segment of length $S$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_abercrombie_shadows.svg

    ...this last claim follows from the following
    diagram:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_abercrombie_s1s2p1p2.svg

    The point is that

    $$
    \overline{s_1s_2}\, > \,\overline{p_1p_2}
    $$

    because $s_1$ and $s_2$ are separated by a
    pair of parallel lines that are at distance
    $\overline{p_1p_2}$ from one another, and
    because at least one of $s_1$, $s_2$ is
    not on either of the parallel lines (or else
    we would have $s_1 = p_1$, $s_2 = p_2$, and
    the segment $s_1s_2$ would not clear the arc).

    Therefore, each segment of $P$ has length
    less than its corresponding “shadow segment”
    on the crossover segment of length $S$, from
    which $S > P$, from which this arrangement
    of values...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_abercrombie_to_the_left_second.svg

    ...on the number line is an impossibility,
    i.e., $S \geq A$.
    This constitutes the proof of the Abercrombie
    inequality.

    One can polish a few more details by noting that:

    |> TextParent
        |> p
            style=text-indent:-1.3em;padding-top:1em;padding-bottom:0.5em;padding-left:3em;padding-right:1.5em;

            *(i)* the segment can be tangent to the
            arc at one point, the proof will still go
            through (so the segment does not need to
            _strictly_ clear the arc);

        |> p
            style=text-indent:-1.6em;padding-top:0em;padding-bottom:1em;padding-left:3em;padding-right:1.5em;

            *(ii)* as long as the angle is nonzero,
            and the arc has nonzero radius, the
            length of the segment will be STRICTLY
            GREATER than the length of the arc,
            not just greater-or-equal-to

    (Point *(ii)* can be seen by
    comparing the segment to a two-segment
    assemblage that is shorter than the segment
    itself, but still-as-long-as-the-arc, by virtue
    of the original inequality.)

    *The Gregorinovich sandwich.*
    The “Gregorinovich sandwich”—sometimes
    Gr_i_gorinovich—states that
    !! |> span
    !!     style=text-decoration:underline
    !!     i
    !! _gorinovich—states that

    $$
    \sin(\theta) \,<\, \theta \,<\, {\sin(\theta)\over\cos(\theta)}
    $$

    for all $0 < \theta < \eta$.
    The Gregorinovich sandwich is so-called because
    !! $\theta$ is “sandwiched”
    it “sandwiches” $\theta$
    between
    $$
    \sin(\theta)
    $$
    below, and
    $$
    {\sin(\theta)\over\cos(\theta)}
    $$
    !! (futurely known as “$\tan(\theta)$”)
    above. (Indeed,
    $$
    {\sin(\theta)\over\cos(\theta)} > \sin(\theta)
    $$
    in the range $0 < \theta < \eta$
    because dividing by
    $$
    \cos(\theta)
    $$
    makes you
    _|BIGGER|_
    when $0 < \cos(\theta) < 1$, which is the case
    for $0 < \theta < \eta$—in fact, dividing by
    $\cos(\theta)$ will make you
    _|DRAMATICALLY BIGGER|_
    when $\cos(\theta)$ is close to $0$, which is the
    case when $\theta$ is close to $\eta$, $0 < \theta < \eta$.)

    !! The Gregorinovich sandwich
    !! consists of two separate
    !! inequalities that require two separate proofs.
    !! The Gregorinovich
    !! sandwich is so-called because it consists of

    !! _|TWO|_

    !! inequalities, the first being

    !! $$
    !! \sin(\theta) \rt{0.1}<\, \theta
    !! $$

    !! and the second being

    !! $$
    !! \,\theta \,<\rt{0.1} {\sin(\theta)\over\cos(\theta)}
    !! $$

    !! ...with each inequality requiring a separate proof.

    The first inequality

    $$
    \sin(\theta) \rt{0.1}<\rt{0.1} \theta
    $$

    follows by this illustration (using $0 < \theta < \eta$):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_fisher_first_ineq.svg

    Namely, per the one slightly pedantic logic,

    $$
    \theta > L
    $$

    on the one hand, where $L$ is the length of
    the dotted chord, and

    $$
    L > \sin(\theta)
    $$

    on the other hand. Together, this implies
    $\theta \rt{0.1}>\rt{0.1} \sin(\theta)$.

    For the second inequality, we have to start
    by noting that

    $$
    {\sin(\theta)\over \cos(\theta)} = {1\over \cos(\theta)}\cdot \sin(\theta)
    $$

    is the length that $\theta$ projects onto
    the line $x = 1$:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_fisher_second_ineq.svg

    Specifically,

    $$
    {1\over \cos(\theta)}
    $$

    turns the bottom segment of length $1$
    into the pink hypotenuse, because just as ‘cos’
    is the hypotenuse-to-adjacent multiplicative
    factor, so is ‘$1/\!\cos$’ the adjacent-to-hypotenuse
    multiplicative factor (don't be confused by the
    presence of two possible triangles to which
    this can be applied); then,

    $$
    \sin(\theta)
    $$

    brings one over to the right-hand segment
    from the pink hypotenuse, being the
    hypotenuse-to-opposite multiplicative
    factor.

    The fact that

    $$
    {\theta} \rt{0.1}<\rt{0.1} {\sin(\theta)\over \cos(\theta)}
    $$

    then follows from the “polished” version
    of the Abercrombie inequality. (The version
    that allows the segment to be tangent to the
    arc, and that claims a strict inequality.)

|> Section

    *The angle-sum formulas.*
    In the “famous diagram” from above there
    are a total of four different ways to
    reach an outer edge by means of ‘cos’
    and ‘sin’ arrows while starting from the
    edge of length $1$, reaching each of the
    four other outer edges precisely once:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_angle_sum_1.svg

    (Note by the way that $0 \leq \theta_1 \leq \eta$,
    $0 \leq \theta_2 \leq \eta$ because of
    the way the figure is constructed, which
    implies that $\sin(\theta_1\!\rt{0.1})$,
    $\cos(\theta_1\!\rt{0.1})$,
    $\sin(\theta_2\!\rt{0.1})$ and $\cos(\theta_2\!\rt{0.1})$
    are all nonnegative, and that all their
    products are nonnegative, as well.)

    On the other hand, if we inscribe the
    figure in the unit circle with the joint angle
    $\theta_1 + \theta_2$ at the center, we find that

    $$
    \,\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)\,
    $$

    and

    $$
    \,\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)\,
    $$

    make an appearance as coordinates, and
    that these coordinates can be expressed as
    sums or differences of the four outer edges:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_angle_sum_2.svg

    (Or with $\theta_1 + \theta_2 > \eta$...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_angle_sum_3.svg

    ...works as well!)

    In other words, we find...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_angle_sum_formulas_flowers.svg

    ...for $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ as may
    appear in such a figure, i.e., for
    $0 \leq \theta_1, \theta_2 \leq \eta$. In
    fact, these two formulas hold for _all_
    $\theta_1$, $\theta_2 \in \rr$. They are
    known as the _angle-sum formulas_. Also
    note the “pattern” of the angle-sum formulas:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_angle_sum_formulas_by_heart.svg

    The point of remembering these patterns
    is that, on their own, these patterns are

    __enough__

    (Well, a lot of students remember the formulas
    that way, at least.)

    *The missing arrows.*
    ‘sin’ and ‘cos’ only constitute two out
    of six ratios that exist among the sides
    of a right triangle. The four “missing ratios”
    are hereby drawn:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_missing_arrows_veiled.svg

    In fact, there is a dedicated, named function
    that computes each of the six ratios. We shall
    now reveal the names of the four missing
    functions (!!):

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_missing_arrows_unveiled.svg

    Here
    “sec” is short for _secant_,
    “tan” is short for _tangent_,
    “cot” is short for _cotangent_, and
    “csc” is short for _cosecant_.

    To be clear, multiplying by

    $$
    \sec(\theta)
    $$

    takes you from ‘adjacent’ to ‘hypotenuse’, multiplying by

    $$
    \csc(\theta)
    $$

    takes you from ‘opposite’ to ‘hypotenuse’, multiplying by

    $$
    \tan(\theta)
    $$

    takes you from ‘adjacent’ to ‘opposite’,
    and multiplying by

    $$
    \cot(\theta)
    $$

    takes you from ‘opposite’ to ‘adjacent’. (!)

    You may observe that

    $$
    \sec = {1\over \cos}
    $$
    and that
    $$
    \csc = {1\over \sin}
    $$

    as multiplying by ‘cos’ undoes the work
    of multiplying by ‘sec’, and likewise for
    ‘sin’ and ‘csc’; also,

    $$
    \,\tan = {1\over \cot},
    $$
    $$
    \cot = {1\over \tan}
    $$

    modulo a very small technicality (to do
    with the fact that ${1\over \infty} \ne 0$,
    or to do with the fact that
    what people think of as “$\pm\infty$”
    is, in fact, an _undefined_ value of the function),
    and

    $$
    \tan \,=\, \sec \cdot \sin \,\,=\,\, {\sin\!\!\!\!\phantom{1}\over \cos}
    $$
    $$
    \cot \,=\, \csc \cdot \cos \,\,=\,\, {\cos\!\!\!\!\phantom{1}\over \sin}
    $$

    since one way to reach ‘opposite’ from
    ‘adjacent’ is to go via ‘hypotenuse’, and
    vice-versa for reaching ‘adjacent’ from
    ‘opposite’. (In fact, the next-to-last
    identity played a role in our proof of the
    Gregorinovich sandwich.) (Indeed,

    $$
    %\sin(\theta) < \theta < \tan(\theta)\rt{0.1}
    \sin(\theta) < \theta < \tan(\theta)\rt{0.1}
    $$

    !! ...in this form, as well!)
    is another way of writing the Grigorinovich
    sandwich.)

    *Secant: a second view.*
    We will point out that

    $$
    \sec(\theta)
    $$

    is also the multiplicative factor that takes 
    you from the

        PURPLE

        LIME GREEN
    \ triangle (hard to draw, because it is
    behind the purple triangle!) in the following
    figure:

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_secant_reinterpretation_1.svg

    Indeed, the scaling factor that is needed
    to turn the purple into the lime green
    triangle is the solution $A$ to

    $$
    A\cdot \cos(\theta) = 1
    $$

    which gives

    $$
    A = {1\over \cos(\theta)} = \sec(\theta)
    $$

    using $\sec = 1/\cos$.

    (After all, this multiplicative factor...

    |> Image
        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_secant_reinterpretation_2.svg

    ...was always going to equal
    this multiplicative factor...

        src=images/svg_ch5_ch_secant_reinterpretation_3.svg

    ...given that the target segment has length $1$ each time!)

    _Postscript._
    Similarly,

    $$
    \csc(\theta)
    $$

    is the multiplicative factor that takes you 
    from the

    *Note on calculators.*
    Your calculator has “degree mode” and
    “radian mode”. If your calculator tells
    you that

    $$
    \cos(1.57)
    $$

    is a number close to $1$, instead of being
    a number close to $0$, it means that your
    calculator is in “degree mode”—it has treated
    as $1.57$ as a number of degrees, instead of
    as a number of radians! (Be sure, in any
    case, that you're in the mode that you want.)
